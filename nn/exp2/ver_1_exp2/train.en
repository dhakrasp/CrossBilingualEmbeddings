On both sides of the threshold the goddesses of the Ganges and the Yamuna river seated on their carriers are carved .
Kurmavatar , Uma-Maheshwar and Lakulish statues carved in the temple indicate the initial stage of sculpture .
Kurmavatar , Uma-Maheshwar and Lakulish statues carved in the temple later achieve maturity .
The top of the temple is a completely new construction .
In place of 8th century arch style , dome like new top has been built .
Two half pictures and one Lakulish statue attached on the internal wall of the canopy seem to be installed later .
In fact the original place of these rock plates would have been on the platform of the temple .
The subject matter of the half picture plates is dance , music and drinking .
Basically the temple was built on a large platform .
Some constituents of the large platform of the temple are still left .
For communication of light and air in the circumambulation path of the sanctum sanctorum two ventilators on four pillars have been built .
Kumbhaswami or Kumbhashyam was originally a Vaishnav temple .
According to the Kirti Stambha edicts , renovation of the Kumbhaswami or Kumbhashyam temple was done by King Kumbhakarna -LRB- Maharana Kumbha -RRB- .
Due to renovation being done by Maharana Kumbha it started to be known with the names like Kumbhaswami and Kumbhashyam etc .
This temple is contemporary of the Kalika Mata temple and its architecture planning and style also matches with it .
On the one side where the architecture plan of the temple , prominent and blank back , undecorated thighs and circumambulation path , the god statues of the outer crevices of the sanctum sanctorum seem to be a construction of 8th century .
At the same time other decorations , seminary canopy standing on pillars and the top would have been constructed later during the renovation time in the 15th century .
Due to being built in different periods this temple of Kumbhaswamy has cherished several examples of architecture styles and statue crafts .
According to Shri Dhaki it was King Manbhanga who built this temple also .
King Manbhanga has the credit of building the temples like Kalika Mata Sun Temple , the nearby Tadaga and Tripurvijaya Prasada etc .
According to Shri Dhaki the Kumbhaswamin Alam of the Kirtistambha edict was the ancient Tripur Vijaya .
Kumbha had rebuilt the ancient Tripur Vijaya Kumbhaswamin Alam .
The seminary canopy of the present Kumbhashyam temple has been rebuilt with the ancient ruins and new stones .
New Vaishnava statues have been installed instead of old dilapidated Shaiva statues .
Protected Shaiva temples have been kept as it is .
Ashwadhar , Naradhara built on the back of the temple and total lack of the grass bar certainly defines it to be of the 8th century .
Kumbhashyam is a Sandhan type of east facing structure .
The sanctum sanctorum of the temple is of the Trayanga type .
Every part of the sanctum sanctorum is attached with a salilantar .

In the edict of Kumarapala is found the evidence of his being a Shiva worshipper only .
According to the Mohaparajay play of Yashpal , Kumarapal had accepted Jain religion in 1159 A . . -LRB- Samvat 1216 -RRB- , however late .
The depiction of scenes available in the Samadhishwar Temple is generally found from all the Jain and Hindu temples .
The palatial materials and Takshak of Jain and Hindu religions used to be the same .
Thus the Samadhishwar Temple appears to be a Shaivite mansion from top to end instead of Kumarpala Vihara .
The Mahesha statue of the Shiva of Samadhishwar Temple that is Vamadev is a form of direct Bhairav .
The largeness and wonderfulness of the Mahesha statue is unique .
The Mahesha statue that is Vamadev seems to be of later than 15th century from the point of view of style .
The ground of sanctum sanctorum is lower than the internal canopy .

The drops of elixir fell on the Earth at four places .
First in Prayag , then Nasik , Ujjain and in Haridwar .
Since then till today Kumbh and Ardhkumbh fairs are organised at all these four places at times .
According to a story , Brahma and Rishis questioned Sheshnag regarding Prayag being the king among pilgrimages .
On being told by Sheshnag Brahma put all the pilgrimages and Saptpuris on one side of libra and only Prayag on the other but the scale shifted towards Prayag and then Prayag 's status as the king of pilgrimages was established .

Sometimes the Kumbha of Nasik takes place before Ujjain .
Kumbha festival cycle is as follows .
The Kumbh festivals of all the four places have been related with the astrological calculation and the main dates of bathing .
There have been different opinions of various scholars regarding the Kumbh cycle .
Some scholars fix Kumbh festival in the twelfth year itself .
According to the second opinion the auspicious time of Kumbh does not occur until the astrological conjunction does not form .
If the equation of the other planets do not agree then the Kumbh festival can take place in the eleventh and the thirteenth year also .
This kind of situation arises because of the western effect of Jupiter and the time of its revolution around the Sun .
Jupiter plays an important role in deciding some festivals .
From the point of view of the division of time , from among 27 Nakshatras and 12 sun signs and 9 planets , the 11th sun sign is the Aquarious .
Aquarius is an aquatic sun sign .
Saturn is the boss .
Saturn is the air element .
Water and air this is the environment .
Sun , Earth , Fire elements obviously have importance .
The Kumbh of Haridwar is symbolic of this very sun sign .
One day of Gods is equivalent to the one year of the humans .
This is the reason why according to the serial order of the position of the planets , Kumbh festival is celebrated at four places in the twelfth year .
This festival itself is the synonym of the fair .
It becomes clear from the study of the Puranas that the Kumbha festival and the Ganges have a special relationship .
Ganga is obviously there in Prayag .

It is known by the name of Gautami .
Shipra becomes eastward from the place where it was once hugged by Ganga .

Just as we reached the Bedi Port our sights fell on a big group of birds , and dolphins hopping on the surface of water also was seen .
We started our travel from the Bedi Port .
Just as we reached the Port our eyes fell on a large group of birds which became invisible from eyes touching the shore in seconds .
We had not yet covered even a few minutes of our journey as luck gave us company and we saw dolphins hopping on the surface of water .
Seeing these dolphins playing in water it was appearing as if they were welcoming our arrival to this island .
As we were reaching near the island , mangrove forest and bevy of different kinds of birds sitting on its branches were getting clearer to our eyes .
Preying birds like hover and marsh herrier were flying at some height above the level of water with their focussed eyes and sharp claws .
As soon as it saw a prey , it pounced with the electrical agility on them and got hold of them in its sharp claws .
Here we also got to see a bevy of rare birds like pallas 's fish also .
From far off the light house of Pirotan Island was visible to us . .
In about two hours we covered this journey filled with adventure .
Wearing a cover of the golden sand on the shores of this island innummerable crabs crawling on the ground will come to your sight .

As if a standstill came in the surface of the sea , that is , the situation of low tide was created .
With the guide of the forest department Sheelu Bhai we went out to see the unique scene of life in water .
Here in the clean water we got to see so many ranges of rocks of coral .
Seeing these rocks it was appearing as if it was a treasure of preciuos stones .
In reality , these dazziling ranges of rocks play the role of security shield to micro-organism , with the decreasing level of water and the effect of light this range turn more beautiful and colorful .
The first sea creature on which our sights fell was octopus .
Perhaps it had got a feeling of the fact that we had seen it and like a lizard it adapted itself in the color of the stone .
For the first time we were seeing any sea creature so closely .
On the surface of its body there were several small pores .
Through which it tightens its prey strongly in its hold .
The speciality of this illusory creature is that it can adapt itself into different color according to the environment .
As soon as Sheelu Bhai freed it , it emitted liquid substance of black color into water and disappeared like smoke .
There are many such creatures in the sea that use their unique abilities either to hunt or to protect themselves from getting hunted .
Star fish can separate its arms from its body as soon as it comes in the clutches of the hunter .
Fish named puffer can even enlagre its body three times bigger that its real size .
Seeing it any one can get hallucinated that it is a powerful big fish .
It was a thrilling view to see different races of crabs present here .
Apart from blue neptune , red coral the upper part of the body of some was covered with thorny hair , which Sheelu Bhai gave the name of wolf crab .
Just in a while our meeting with star fish and puffer fish also occurred .
As soon as Sheelu Bhai picked up the puffer fish in his hands it bloated like a balloon .
It is really a workable mechanism for protection .
One more interesting fact about this fish is that puffer is one among those fish which can blink its eyelids .
A different type of octopus , jelly fish , red coral which looks very attractive .
With the kingfisher many alluring and unique birds are visible in the port which keep the environment resonant .
To see these creatures living in the water you may have to get down two to three feet into water .
Therefore tourists should keep special care for this fact that they wear such shoes which can keep them protected from the poisonous creatures living in water .
In the clean water of the sea , groups of colorful sea lily and sea pen enchanted us .
Looking like a garden in reality this beautiful view is not of any flora but of group of sea creatures .
Which while attracting fish and other small creatures towards themselves make them their prey .
As the day started to pass by we came back to the island .
Far from the life of town filled with hubbub and hurly burly there is also a shrine where local people came sometimes and performed namaz .
There is neither proper arrangement for food nor for drinking water on this island therefore before coming here tourists should make proper arrangements for drinking water and food .
Generally all the tourists return back by the evening but we decided to spend the night here and we got permission too .
When the redness of the setting sun behind the horizon fall on this island then its natural beauty gets enhances four folds .
In the darkness of the night in this peaceful island only squeals of the waves are heard .
While returning from the island we saw kingfisher on the mangrove .

Early morning the minute it was seven we started our journey .
Trees had left our company since long , now only a few plants could be seen on the grass .
On route we could see three potholes , our guide told that the name of this place is Pathar Nachodi .
It is said that three apsarahs had been sent to break the ascetic practice of some hermit .
On the ascetic practice being broken the hermit overpowered by anger turned the fairies to stone .
But in the stone form also the dance of those fairies continued so , the hermit buried them in the potholes .
The opinion of local people was this , but the opinion of some people is this that these potholes might have been produced due to the falling of lightening .
Now there was the challenging sharp climb , we were at a height of more than 13,000 feet , each step was becoming heavy .
Approximately after walking three kilometers it started snowing , carefully stepping on the snow all reached Rupkhand by half past seven .
Ice was frozen on the lake and a little away from there we also found human remains .
Everyone 's eyes were moist , success was not felt yet .
Gradually everyone began to believe that ultimately we have reached Rupkhund .
Then what , the skies revererated with victory cries of Shiva ji and Nanda Devi .
Ahead there was a small temple of Nanda Devi ji , everyone bowed heads respectfully and distributed offerings of Rasagullas .
Everyone was eager to capture this unique scene in their cameras .
They were reminded that the journey has not yet ended instead scaling more height now had to reach Shila samudra via Jorawar lane .
Ahead there was only snow but everyone 's courage was high .
The guide and his comapnions started making a path by cutting ice with an ice axe .
Crossing the 1,000 feet height now we were at the edge of Joravar lane .
The weather was clear , ahead were the skyscraping peaks of Mrigthuni , Trishul and Nandaghunti .
After watching these rare sights from this height of 17,500 feet for sometime we started descending the other side with the help of a rope .
After crossing the snow only stones could be seen , this was Shilasamudra .
On one side of us was Mrigathuni , the other side was Trishul and on the third side Nandaghunti peaks and we had just come from the fourth i . . Rupkhand .
Shilasamudra is a bottomless sea of stones .
On the road from Shilasamudra to Homkund there are only stones .
There was a need for great caution on the road from Shilasamudra to Homkund .
Each footstep had to be kept fixedly , from some distance we found Nandakini river coming from Nandaghunti glacier .
We were advancing forward finding a path among stones with care in the direction of the left bank of Nandakini .
Evening four o'clock we reached near two large rocks , it is called Dodang , this only was our night camp .
Our goal was yet two kilometers away from Homkund .
Dodang place was in the asolute middle of Nandaghunti and Trishul peaks and where the two peaks meet , that is called Ronti Central .
There was a severe winter in Dodang , by six o'clock the waters of the close flowing Sarita froze .
Just then we got sight of a rare animal Bharal , because of the false knowledge of there not being any danger from us these mountain goats , looking like deer , with their families began playing near us .

Tsomoriri lake . piece of the blue sky on the ground .
At a distance of 240 kilometer from Leh included in the protected area , situated in the midst of extensive mountain ranges and the roost of diversified birds at one end of the world the beauty of Tsomoriri lake is unique .
I am talking of the Tsomoriri lake , which is probably situated at one end of the world .
The calm deep blue color of the water of Tsomoriri lake makes this appear as if a piece of blue sky has come falling on the earth .
Situated at a height of approximately 15000 feet from the earth the Tsomoriri lake is 23 kilometer long and from eight to ten kilometer wide .
The mountains on four sides of Tsomoriri lake are always covered with snow .
Situated in the Rupshu valley of Ladakh the extremely beautiful Tsomoriri lake is the breeding place for many kinds of birds .
From June till September months specific kinds of swans , high crested birds and Brahmani ducks can be seen swimming in large numbers .
The sweet water of Tsomoriri lake is an invaluable gift of many migratory birds .
After crossing a distance of 250 kilometers from Leh we had reached Tsomoriri in the month of September .
In Ladakhi language the meaning of Tso is lake .
For coming till Tsomoriri lake , we had to cross Leh , Upsi , Chumathang , Mahe and Piga .
In the middle falls Nam Sangla valley whose height is approximztely 15,000 feet .
Approximately 10 kilometers ahead from here is a small canal , on crossing the bridge constructed on which Moriri lake begins .
Outside strong freezing winds are blowing .
It is not possible to stand till much time in the strong freezing winds and be able to take the pleasure of the beauty of the lake .
According to Dorjee -LRB- driver -RRB- we were going to Karzok , the village at the border .
For going to Karzok the road runs along the edge of the lake .
After going five kilometers ahead from the road at the edge of the lake Karzok village comes .
Karzok village is the permanent residence place of an aborigines Changpa .
Sustaining the bad weather of Karzok the Changpa people do farming of barley here .
It is believed that farming of barley in the highest area of the world is done in Karzok .
Changpa rear yak , sheep and goat and live all year in tents made of the black colored fur of the yak .
Pashmina goats are valuable assets of the Changpa people .
In days of winter thick hair grows on Pashmina goats .
In days of summer the Changpa people make an accumulation of the hair shed by the Pashmina goats .
The hair shed by the Pashmina goats is called pashm .
The famous Pashmina shawls of Kasmir are made from pashm only .
We had become tired by continuously doing mountain trekking for six hours .
We were also feeling very hungry .
On reaching Karzok having eaten hot Khichdi at a small restaurant made in a parachute tent the hunger subsided .
When we stretched our arms and legs sometime in the warmth of the bed laid in the tent , then we felt alive and the desire to do something awakened .
We went to see the only Gompa -LRB- budhha temple -RRB- of the village situated in the vicinity .
The entrance door of the main temple of the gompa -LRB- budhha temple -RRB- is very colorful and pictorial .
Having climbed the roof of the inclusion room of the gompa saw Tsomoriri ourselves .
The heart lifted up on having seen a fascinating flock of birds of Tsomoriri with binoculars .
From the roof of the gompa tried to see the tents of the Changpa aborigines , but could not see .
Maybe on going more ahead from here viewing would have happened .
The map of Karzok is changing with the new buildings constructed of concrete according to the usage of the cities .
Its obvious that in this way there can be infiltration unknowingly in the natural beauty and tradition of the village .
Seeing this from the roof of Gompa wished that if there remained fixed a traditional culture here instead of modern culture then .. . such a unique view would have been seen .
Tsomoriri situated in Rupshu valley is a cultural area .
Therefore for entering in Tsomoriri travellers require a permission letter .
On requesting this permission letter can be obtained free from the deputy collector office situated near of the polo ground of Leh .
The permission letter is obained for minimum four persons and maximum for one week .
Travellers are given advice that make many photo copies of the permission letter because this is asked at many check posts .
Consume adequate water during journey .
The way of water consumption compensates less oxygen in the environment .

The untouched beauty of Binsar .
Small but filled with natural beauty and historic importance Binsar is an extremely charming hilly place of Uttaranchal .
In the months of October the nature of Binsar is at its full youth .
Among famous hilly spots a one pleasure giving peaceful spot like this only is Binsar .
Situated in Almora district the historical importance of Binsar is also told .
For staying in Binsar the rest house of Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam is also there but we made arrangements of our staying in the ancient and famous forest rest house in Binsar .
From Delhi going via Gajraula , Haldwani , Bhuvali we stopped for some time on route for visit in the famous Kanchi temple .
On Almora Bageshwar road 22 kilometers away from Almodra from a place named Kafadkhan the road of Binsar separates from the main road .
Here at a barrier of the forest department the checking of our permit was done and the fixed tax for tourists and car was recovered from us and our entry was made in a register .
The path from here to Binsar was very narrow and we were having to drive the car with great care .
On route we could also see famous ancient temples .
The road otherwise was of 12 kilometers only but due to the road being narrow to reach Binsar it had taken us approximately three quarter of an hour .
At the very first we saw the rest house of Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam in whose courtyard a windmill and the mountain peaks of the Himalays behind were perceptible .
The rest house here is truly an imposing building .
There are two rooms in this rest house of white color .
The bedroom and sitting rooms were quite big and old style furniture had been put here with great order .
A beautiful picture of the Himalaya mountain peak visibe from the highest spot in Binsar was put up in the sitting room .
Outside the rest room was the kitchen and the courtyard was kept decorated with stones .
Either the tourists coming here bring along the materials for meals and use the kitchen here .
In the evening along with some tourists we saw the charming sight of sunset from here .
Here our meeting happened with a young man named Pradeep who was going to take us to the highest place in Binsar , Zero Point in the morning .
The next morning it was very cold .
We were walking fast for Zero Point because we wanted to see the sight of the first rays of the Sun falling on the frozen white peaks of the Himalayas .
One advantage of coming here in the month of November was this that the sky was absolutely clear .
Ahead the peaks of the Himalayas were touching the sky with pride .
Pradeep told us the names of some of the peaks from these like Chowkhamba , Nanda Devi , Nandakoti and Panch Chuli .
One by one the white colored peaks began to turn gold and soon everything became golden .
We all began to capture this unique natural sight in our cameras .
After the sun rose more the peak became white again and soon fog also descended .

This is the largest lake in the 20 lakes of Kerala .

People from all parts of the world come here for seeing the beauty , lake , water and migratory birds .
A large tourism and resort operator like the Oberoi group has been proven unsuccessful in getting this in spite of having bid for this beautiful island .
For this environmentalists should be given thanks , who opposed this .
Beautiful Pathiramnal is convenient in equal form for both the poor and the rich .

After disembarking in Zurich I walked towards beautiful and cosmopolitan city Geneva .
This on common basis gives birth to the confusion of Switzerland being the capital , but is not .
Maybe the reason of this is that the whole world like the headquarters of United Nations , the World Health Organization , Red Cross and International Labor Organization etc is there .
All these , especially the United Nations are places worth visiting .
The best thing is this that you can roam most places walking and the rest one or two places by bus .
Then it was said that I should definitely see an important archaeological place , Cathedral Saint Pierre .
If these type of things do not attract you much , then you can also leave it .
But if you like places like these then you can spend your some time there .
Later . went to Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum .
Here the human atrocities happening in the recent history has been documented in the form of films , statues and sound tracks .
But the thing about Geneva I liked the most and is also maybe the favorite of the tourists .
That is walking along Geneva lake and admiring Jet d'Eau .
One such a big fountain -LRB- and the largest in Europe also -RRB- which throws water down from 140 metres high in the air .
The favorite work of the tourists is to keep standing there so some drops of water spread by gusts of wind touch their face with love .
For this place you will not need any directions , because this is seen from anywhere in the whole city .
From my experience I can say this that less expensive hotels are in reality not less expensive .
The best alternative is Youth Hostel , where the expenditure of one night comes near of 14 dollars .
After deciding the place of staying , roaming is most expensive .
The better alternative is this that take travel pass .
In Switzerland there are many types of passes available which are the best for you , choose that .
Now also this is right that take rail pass , journey of bus and boat remain included in this .

It was not that there was less money with us , and for that reason we did not go up .

Anoushka Shankar told Spriha Srivastava about the harmonious and beautiful evenings spent in Kopanang and Goa .. .
For enjoying holidays where do you like to go ?
Without losing any moments I would like to take the name of Goa .
Like to go frequently to Goa and spend the best holidays in less money .
But Kopanang of Thailand is that lone place the holidays spent where I can never forget .
I had gone there on a holiday of one week with few friends of England .
There are not any telephones there .
There you will not get any modern comforts like this .
So when we reached there we had no reservations etc .
There you will get ' Tree - House ' made on trees .
You can stay on its platform climbing on the trees .
There is a bathroom there containing flowing water .
But whatever other things are there that can only be called basic .
The area adjoining the shore of the sea is wild .
There the cost of spending one night is just 200 Thai baht .
Apart from this there is nothing as such on which an amount can be spent .
This is why you can call my this holiday a budget holiday in the right meaning .
Any special thing of this place that can not be forgotten even deliberately .
Memories of Kopanang are heart touching ones .
This place is known for events happening on nights of full moon .
There is no proper road there .
Only an island is there .
For going from one island to another island there the only one support is the fish catching boat .
This is why when you get off on another island from one island , there then you suddenly find yourself on a deserted place .
This in itself feels quite attractive .
We had set camp on just some distance from this place .
Where happens the organization of full moon night parties .
Did you participate in any such party organized there ?
I like being included in such parties .
But by bad luck I was not at that place then when the organization of that party happened .
As such this much is fixed that whenever I go on a holiday , then I harbor a desire of complete peace and rest .
Any special place of attraction for travellers there ?
There is one more place whose name is Century Spa Resort .
This is at a distance of two shores from that place , on which shore tree houses are built .
There is a small resort there .
Classes of yoga are run over there .
I used to go there every morning taking a walk in the direction of the mountains .
There used to do Yoga practice till few hours and after that used to return .
This was the most peaceful moment of the holidays .
Tell about some more memorable moments , which will always dwell in your heart and mind ?
There was my room partner Vicky .
She is my friend and lives in London .
She and I used to every morning at half past three get awakened on hearing the unknown sound of some big animal .
Every night our condition remained bad with fear .
One night we remained awake to see which animal is that after all .
That was basically a big lizard found in Thailand .
That was almost one feet long and was in our bathroom .
It was like our third room partner in our whole stay there .
In some days we got used towards its coming in the room , hanging on walls and slithering on tooth - brush .
You had also mentioned Goa , is this also your favorite destination of spending holidays ?
Yes , Goa for me is a place like that where I enjoy going again and again .
In less expense only , holidays can be spent there .
For me this is also important in this meaning that this is in our country .
I enjoy going there every year .
But a few years back what used to be the character of Goa , that place has not remained very safe now .
In many matters the desire I harbor to spend such informal holidays with safety , that does not seem possible there .
Now more than enjoyment I go there with a mission of living a peaceful life .
For newlywed couples , who want to go for celebrating honeymoon . will give them advice to go to Kopanang .
For celebrating honeymoon this place is also good , because here happens more romantic experience .
As far as it is a matter of Goa , then in reality should think of going for getting enjoyment with friends there .

it takes only 7 hours in the journey from Mumbai Airport to Nairobi the capital of Kenya .
Nairobi is not only a beautiful city but it has some of its own specialities that differentiate it from other cities .
Contrary to the general belief about African cities Nairobi is not hot .
Due to being situated about 1500 metres above the sea level Shimla or Mussoorie like weather keep on in Nairobi throughout the year .
People do not have even fans in their houses in Nairobi .
Another specialty of Nairobi is this that only 4 wheeled vehicles are seen here which are in the form of grand foreign cars .
So far as the question of Indian citizens lies then in Nairobi almost every second - third shops is run by Indian or Pakistani .
Hindi and Gujarati are heard in every streets of Nairobi and Indian sari , lahanga etc . are common clothes there .
It is also advised to be a little cautious about Nairobi .
Incidents like stealing , snatching , cheating and robbery etc keep on taking place .
Therefore tourists should avoid going alone to any strange place .
The biggest speciality of Nairobi are the National Parks thereof which are located at a distance of only 7 kilometres in the south of the city .
In fact when the aeroplane lands at the Nairobi Airport then if the traveller see outside through the window then may be they will get to see giraffe running holding its head up .
There is a major national park of Nairobi .
This national park is the major industry tourism of Kenya which depend on these unique animals and these animals are such that are found only in Africa .
For example the names of African zebra , giraffe , ostrich , impala , panther , lion , elephant , rhinoceros etc . can be counted .
Tourists from Europe , America , Canada , Australia come to see them in big numbers .
Contrary to expectation most of the parks of Kenya are large fields of grass instead of dense forest where one to one and a half metre grass or bush is seen far and wide .
In these parks of Kenya small and big animals keep their residence built up .
Zebra , giraffe , lion , rhinoceros , sea horse , wild boar , ostrich etc . can be seen in these parks of Kenya .
Thus from almost any place of Kenya one or another national animal park will be found within a distance of 50 - 100 kilometres to see which tourists can go .
Stay and food facilities are also on these tourist places of Kenya .
Although the easiest place for common tourist in Nairobi is the Nairobi National Park .
In the Nairobi National Park tourists can do ` jambo ' -LRB- Swahili word for hello or welcome -RRB- with different kinds of animals within 4 . hours .
There are hundreds of travel agencies in Nairobi where the tickets for national parks can be booked .
The rates of these tour tickets are 80 - 100 American dollars -LRB- around 3500 to 5 thousand rupees -RRB- .
The fee of entry in the national park 40 dollars is also included .
When we booked the ticket of this safari then at half past 7 in the morning a beautiful and comfortable van came to our hotel .
Its driver was a soft-spoken African who was also our guide .
The roof of the vehicle used to open from above standing in which wild animals can be seen from nearby .
Completing a distance of about 18 kilometres from the hotel the main gate of the National Park became visible to us .
The driver bought the tickets etc at the main gate of the national park and fulfilled other formalities and then the train entered into the national park .
At first in the national park on a tree a large bird -LRB- vulture like -RRB- got visible .
The guide said that it was ' marshal eagle ' which flies while capturing small animals and birds in its claws .
On moving ahead in the national park the trees ended and the large field of grass became visible .
A memorial was seen at a place of the national park .
Guide said that at that place of the national park a huge store of ivory was destroyed by burning .
Several foreign tourists were taking pictures of that place -LRB- memorial -RRB- of the national park .
In the field of the national park some among the trees scattered distantly were appearing more than the normal height .
On observing attentively we got to know that they were not tall trees rather standing giraffe keeping their heads high .
Then varieties of animals became visible in the National Park .
In the National Park at first flock of a special kind of deer was seen grazing whose name was gnu .
In the national park after some time with constant labor of the driver lions were seen , among them 2 were females and 1 male .
Our vehicle reached pretty much near the lions .
There were 3 . more tourist vehicles the foreign youths in which had kept on taking pictures of the lions .
Holding their tail and ears the lions sitting cosily would see the deer grazing nearby in between and again would sit back .
Moving ahead from that place in the national park ostriches were seen .
The guide said that among the ostriches the soil gray ones were females and the one which is big and black in the middle was male .
Ahead of that place in national park a large group of zebra was seen .
After this in the national park zebra , wild buffaloes , deer etc . were seen like a common view and among the same we also saw some buffaloes at some places .
Guide said that among 5 big animals of Africa the names of lion , jaguar , elephant , rhinoceros , buffalo come .
All these animals of the national park are called big not just because of its size but they are called because they are extremely dangerous .
If all these animals of the national park go after someone then his escape is very difficult .
In the starting days when hunters used to come to Africa with the goal of hunt then the hunter who hunted these big animals were considered brave .
Among these 5 big animals the most dangerous are buffaloes .
When I told the guide that in India people raise these buffaloes and also drink their milk then the guide informed us just then that the pet buffaloes of India are water buffaloes .
But the these buffaloes of the national park are king buffaloes which can never be made pet and are very dangerous .
Given a chance these buffaloes of the national park also defeat lions .
In one road of the national park a wild boar was seen whose two big teeth were jutting out .
Moving ahead further in the national park two panthers were seen sitting on a small cliff .
Turning the vehicle the driver brought it just near them and stopped and said that panther is fastest running animal of the world .
Seeing a foreign lady , who was running her vehicle alone , also came near and started taking the films of the panthers .
Moving thus we came out from near the eastern gate of the national park which is very near to the Nairobi Airport .
It took us about 4 hours in touring the national park .

In 1638 AD , Mughal Emperor Shahjahan had taken the decision of changing his headquarters from Agra and settling a new capital near the old ruins of Firozabad beside the Yamuna river .
In Delhi a huge and effective Red Fort embellished with strong , walls , gates , minarets and arches was built in about eight years .
Emperor Shahjahan had ruled from here itself residing in the Red Fort .
This fort in itself was a royal city in which about 5000 people used to live .
The decoration of the Red Fort is unique .
In conception the Red Fort is octagonal .
Two long walls in the east and west of the Red Fort and there are six small walls in the north and south .
There are several special buildings in the Red Fort .
Out of which Diwan-e-Aam was the hall for the court of the people .
Diwan-e-Khas was the sitting place of the honored people .
Rang-Mahal is renowned as an excellent gem of Shahjahan 's harem .
Nahar-e-Bihist . branch of the Ali Mardan canal , which was source of fountains and waterfalls .
Due to royal and grand buildings of the Red Fort Fergusson had called it the most magnificent palace of the east , possibly the world .
The heritage of the Red Fort is inherent not just in the magnificent of its design or the grandeur of its buildings or the beauty of its gardens or the sound of its fountains .
Each of the stone , each of the pillars , each of the canopy painting and footpath narrate the story of the past era .
All of the places of the Red Fort tell us how this great empire formed .
How unparalleled color of grandeur were filled in the grand buildings of the Red Fort .
How the Red Fort remained the witness of mercy and cruelty .
How a supremely powerful fort finally became the victim of its own pride , inaction and illusion and how it went into the hands of an indifferent and selfish company and later the British rulers .
After a sad event of 1857 the English army captured the Red Fort .
For an obstacle free communication of its soldiers and weapons the English army demolished all the buildings in a hemisphere of about 448 yards towards one side of which was the Jama Masjid and Chandani Chowk and on the other side was the wall of the Red Fort .
Despite such destructive works nearby the Red Fort the English rulers could not escape the glitter of its royal traditions .
This very royal tradition was on its full glitter on 14th December , 1911 when King George the Fifth and his queen dressed in the shining crown and colorful clothes and along with grandeur of the kings had accepted the greetings of about five lac people from the arches of the Red Fort .
For Indian Freedom fighters as well the Red Fort remained a symbol of power .
The slogan given by Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose to his Indian National Army was Dilli Chalo .
Pt . Nehru also hoisted the first flag of independent India on 15 August , 1947 .
For years the Red Fort has borne several downs of the time .
History has left the marks of its wounds on the Red Fort .
The remaining energy of the Red Fort also got destroyed due to carelessness .
Till a few months earlier with the ambience inside and outside near the Red Fort we understand how careless we were towards our cultural wealth .
After becoming the Culture and Tourism minister when I visited the Fort for an intensive study of the Red Fort I saw several dilapidated constructions .
In the eastern direction of the Red Fort there was a filth filled colony where there were Chor Bazar , open urinals and obstacled sewers .
In place of these now a charming park has been built which is spread to the front of the Rajghat from the norther tip of the Red Fort .
Its views appear very beautiful at night when the walls of the Red Fort , urban arches and green parks in front of them create a pleasant environment in the interesting lighting system .
In the same way the neglected area spread high and low towards Chandni Chowk have also been decorated which has been converted into a national park - 15 August Park .

About 28 feet below from the ground of the land in Red Fort there is a bathing pond built with indigenous design and a courtyard to reach where stairs are built .
This moat was not used during the capture of the British-army and prison-cells were built in a bigger part of the courtyard .
The freedom fighters whom the British Intelligence considered dangerous prisoners were brought in these prison-cells for interrogation .
After 1945 these moats and cells of the Red Fort were closed .
Later useless items , wastage and materials of house building were put in them .
A document and information interpretation center is being established at the Red Fort .
Besides providing information regarding the Red Fort this center will also provide comprehensive knowledge of the history from the ancient times to the present time .

Wildlife tourism is well developed in America , Canada and countries of southern Africa like Kenya , Tanjania etc .
Wildlife tourism is a big source of income in countries of eastern Africa .
Thousands of tourists come to the national parks of these countries and enjoy the adventurous forest view here .
Tourists get full happiness of viewing the wildlife in natural condition and take their pictures .

Tourism industry has emerged as the biggest source of earning foreign currency in India but it has been able to attract only 3 percent of the tourists of the world .
India tourism till now has been centred on the places of religious , cultural , historical and geographical importance .
Therefore foreign tourists are given the tour to pilgrimages , ancient temples , historical forts , memorials , memorials , stupas or ruins , art galleries , museums and pleasant cities and sea shores .
Tourism based on wild-life has not yet got priority in India .
Tourists in India do not come with an approach solely towards wild-life tourism .
Still gradually an inclination away from historical and cultural tourism towards entertainment and aesthetics based tourism has come and in this change wild life tourism is also included .
The location of the national parks , forest reserves , tiger reserves and other protected areas in our country is in different views , residing places and climate areas .
Therefore they have a divergence and diversity of fauna and flora in them .
Among the wild animals residing in these protected areas like lions , tigers , panthers , snow-panthers , elephant , wild buffalo , ox , several species of wild sheep and goat , apes , monkeys , squirrels , crocodiles , fish , wild cats , wild dogs , bears etc . along with colorful birds are natural attraction of tourists .
The National Parks of Africa are vast and no damage occurs to them with the entrance of a big number of tourists together in them .
Wild animals like lions of Africa are tolerant towards tourists while the animals like tiger living in the national parks of India are shy and like to stay away from tourists .
It is also a matter of attention that the tourists of African parks are often foreigners which are disciplined and follow the rules and orders with alertness .
Tourists in the parks of India are generally local people who have not yet developed such behavior that are suitable to follow the rules list of the park .
Therefore we will have to prepare rules and regulations and codes of conduct according to our situations to run wild life tourism in our country .
We need to be more alert to systematise and regularise tourists in our national parks .
It has been estimated that among the tourists of the country five percent tourists tour national parks and forest reserves .
In those parks of India that can be reached easily and which has achieved fame wild life tourism has increased there .
Among these parks Kajiranga , Manas , Sundarban , Gir , Corbett , Sultanpur , Tadowa , Sanjay Gandhi , Keoladeo , Sariska , Kanha , Bandipur , Madumalaya , Nagarhole , Bannerghatti , Periyar are prominent .
Latest data of tourists touring every year in all of these parks are not available .
Yet it has been estimated that up to 90,000 in Gir National Park and up to 70,000 tourists in Kajiranga national park reach every year .
About 63 - 70,000 tourists visit in Manas National Park also .
While Periyar National Park attract 2 lac tourists every year .
Sanjay Gandhi National Park Borivali , is quite near Mumbai metropolis and more than 30 lac tourists come here .
In the whole of Asia this is the biggest number entering any protected wild life area .
About 45,000 tourists come to Betla , Corbett and Kanha National parks .
The number of tourists of Sultanpur , Keoladeo and Tadowa national parks is from 60 to 65,000 every year .
30,000 to 35,000 tourists come to Sariska , Bandipur , Sundarban , Bannerghatta and Nagarhole national parks .
The number of tourists in the Madhav and Bandhavgarh national parks of Madhya Pradesh is nearly 5,000 to 10,000 .
Very less tourists reach parks like Dachigam , Valley of Flowers , Namdafa , Indravati , Keibul Lamjao , Pin Valley , Great Himalaya parks which are either distant or unreachable .
However there is no about in it that the number of tourists going to these parks are constantly increasing and in future there is a great possibility of wild life tourism increasing in India in future .
There , for the managers of these parks it is necessary that they prepare early schemes to solve the problem of constantly increasing tourists .
When we talk about wild life tourism then saying this would not be irrelevant that some tourists do not lose to misuse these guest houses .
Showing their wealth they break the peace of the parks .
They create noise by running transistor and tape recorder and musical instruments on these national parks which are forbidden in these parks .
Such people inspire the staff of the guest house by giving the lure of their position and wealth to ignore the discipline and rules of the park .
Guest houses are built in almost all of the parks in our country .
So as no problem of residence occurs on reaching in the park one should reserve these guest houses before .

It is mandatory for tourists to follow some rules to maintain the peace and safety inside the park .
Tourism is mainly for entertainment .
Along with entertainment historical and religious tourism can also be achieved .
But wild life tourism has a different objective and that is evoking awareness towards the protection and conservation of environment .
In this era of the deformity of the nature the message of improvement in the environment has great importance .
To bring this message to the tourists parks can play a certain role .
Tourists should take great precaution and alertness while touring in the complex of the park because any encounter of tourists and wild life due to any lapse can result in sad event .
In this regard reminding the incident of the death of a British bird-lover on 20 January 1985 in Corbett National Park in such an incident would not be irrelevant .
David Hunt reached such a desolate place in the Dhikala forest range following an owl alone where a wild animal killed and ate him .
In the complex of the national park travel is an important part of tourism and this should also be considered .
The wild animals get disturbed with the dust generated by the speed of the vehicles inside the park and the sound of the vehicles .
Therefore controlling their speed and use is necessary .
Till now our national parks are not fully able to fulfil the demands of wild-life .
In some parks the tourists cell is in the core area which is not appropriate with regard to nature protection .
In several parks designated area for tourists has not been demarcated .
Nature interpretation centres have not been established in all the parks for the convenience and guidance of the tourists .
The arrangement of stay , management of traffic in the complex and photo shooting are not available in some national parks .
Despite shortcomings in the wild life tourism attention is definitely being paid on raising its standards in which needs of tourists are fulfilled .
To develop wild life tourism under the Development of National Parks and Sanctuaries project there should be a separate arrangement of financial help for Wild-life tourism .

Our aeroplane was landing at Bahrain Airport .
A melodious voice started echoing in ears , Ahlan wa Sahlan , Alan wa Salan that is Welcome Welcome .
Now the inquisitiveness to see this island started increasing .
Airport staff stamped our passports with a smile and helped us in coming out .
After seeing all these I felt that hospitality has become a part of Bahrain culture .
We had come out .
The blue color of the sky was kissing the horizon .
The effect of cold breeze blowing on Bahrain Island inspite of being brighter and hotter in Sun 's rays . had never experienced this before .
We had started walking towards home .
Cleanliness of the streets , wide roads , high speeding vehicles , white and red flowers of Apomia along the streets were swinging with the flow of wind .
Red and white colors are the symbols of Bahrain 's Nationality .
However if you see in the map Bahrain appears as a small dot .
The group of 36 islands have joined to become 4 main islands now .
The population of Bahrain spread over 706 sq . kms is approximately 6 million .
It was 9 o'clock in the morning .
The sun 's rays were spread all over the place by now .
I was watching the cleanliness and orderliness in Bahrain all around when suddenly the brake was applied and we had reached at the gate of the house .
Next day we went to Manama the capital of Bahrain .
Manama is a very old area of Souk Bahrain .
There were small shops at the both sides extending far into the long narrow streets in Manama Souk .
These shops of Manama Souk remind of bazars in villages .
This traditional market has been going on in Manama Souk for a long time .
Crowd of people , echoing sound , the aroma of delicious cuisines , the fragrance of perfume ... immense movement , sale purchase , exchange all were going on at the same time .
Various kinds of spices , almonds , pistachios , cashews , handicraft items , diamonds and gems - every type of object is available in Manama Souk .

King Fahd Kozer ' Bridge is situated at a distance of 25 kms from Bahrain .
Dark blue color ocean of the Gulfs is visible at the both sides of King Fahd Kozer .
King Fahd Kozer Bridge is a special attraction for the tourists .
Therefore no tourist returns home without seeing King Fahd Kozer Bridge .
King Fahd Kozer Bridge is built on a small island .
King Fahd Kozer Bridge connects Bahrain with Saudi Arabia .
There is an island on this border of Saudi Arabia .
We went and sat in a revolving glass restaurant on this island .
Tourists see Saudi Arabia at a glance by sitting in this restaurant .
Al Fateh Mosque ' is the biggest mosque of the Gulfs .
It was afternoon .
I was wondering if they would let me in Al Fateh Mosque .
Seeing me standing outside a lady came and ushered me in the mosque .
That lady took me around and finally showed me the hall where all people read Namaz prayers sitting side by side .
The cleric of Al Fateh Mosque gave us to eat a popular dish of Bahrain ` Baklawa ' .
The next day early morning my husband and I went for a walk .
When we got tired walking in the desert we sat on a bench .
For miles and miles only sand was visible .
Everything was deserted .
At one end a convoy of camels was slowly moving towards West .
Tired we were looking dreamily at the camel caravan .
A tapping sound came from our back .
When we turned back we saw 2 horsemen were moving ahead talking to each other .
These white and black horses must be of Arabic breed , we were thinking .
Bahrain is a very beautiful and organized country .
In Bahrain stories of social riots , theft , violence , molestation do not appear in the newspapers .
People of Bahrain are peace lovers .
In Bahrain houses are available for the poors at a low price from the Government .
The sick get free medication from the Government in Bahrain .
The desert area of ` Syria ' starts from its capital ` Damascus ' itself .
Newly developed Damascus city has been beautifully adorned with greenery .
Damascus puts the tourists coming in into a confusing state for once if they are really moving around in a desert area .
All around Damascus are wide and clean roads .
Green trees , flowers and grasses at the both sides of the streets and in the middle of some streets enhance the beauty of the city four folds .
The trimming and pruning of all the trees planted along the street sides are done with a great skill .
Hillocks of ` Jabal Kasyun ' visible from New Damasucs city too can not help but attract every tourist coming here .
The meaning of ` Jabal ' in Arabic language is mountain .
The pattern of the greenery of trees growing in rows amidst the multi-storied buildings built on these barren looking hills are visible from far itself .
These mountains of Damascus are mostly of solid rocks .
The muddy colored buildings built on these mountians are mixed up with each other in such a way that the difference between the mountains and the buildings can not be made out in daylight .
The picture of the other side of ` Jabal Kasyun ' which looks barren from the front is completely different .
After coming here it does not look like a barren mountain at all .
The mountain is completely covered with greenery .
This mountain has been decorated as a beautiful park here .
Wide roads , green trees seem to be inviting every tourist to come to them .
Hills spreading around this look like having pattern of greenery and buildings as before .
The Eastern part of Syria adjoining the border of Iraq is desert .
The soil of the Eastern part of Syria is not sandy but rocky unlike other desert areas .
Not even grass grows on this rocky soil .
If we go towards ` Palmira ' city situated in the North-East of Damascus similar kind of barren mountains are seen spreading for miles along with the border of Iraq .
The most surprising thing one gets to see on these mountains is the pine trees grown in rows here and there on these mountains . at some places even the trees grown in groups on these mountains are seen .
It is difficult to explain in words how pleasing the trees grown like this on these barren mountains are to the environment lovers .
To see such a large number of trees being planted in this desert area of Syria like this is also a pleasant hint towards this country 's love for trees and protecting environment from being polluted .
The job of planting trees on these barren mountains of Syria is no doubt done by the Government , Forest and Irrigation Department .
The job of planting trees is also done by school children .
There are special camps set up during school vacations .
These plants are provided free of cost by Forest Department to the school children .
Children are also supposed to grow plants on some land part in Syria and get a clearance certificate before sitting in the board examination .
Only then can children sit in the board examination .
Later on the responsibility of taking care of these plants planted by the children is of Irrigation Department .
These plants are given fertilizers and water from time to time .
These plants are looked after as newborn babies .
We happen to see groups of these trees anywhere on the barren mountains .
It is not that the Government department takes care of the the trees grown on the mountains only .
The responsibility of taking care of the plants  trees of whole of Syria too is of the Governmnet department .
The trees along the streets are trimmed during the autumn season .
So that the trees spread more and grow up in the coming season .
Besides pine trees , one can find various types of trees like dates , palm , fruit trees like orange , lemon , fig and eucalyptus , olive etc . by the road side .
The trimming of palm and dates trees is done properly and regularly with the help of cranes .
The people of Syria love these trees so much that anybody can not even think of illegally cutting them down knowingly or unknowingly .
If someone still commits this type of mistake he may have to face severe punishment .
The wilted trees are cut down and new plants planted immediately at that place by department employees .
Every environment lover toursist coming to Syria can not help getting surprised to see these man-made forests on barren land .
It was not even dawn when the train dropped us off in the deserted silence of Sicily 's oceanic and hill station ` Taormina Giardini Station ' and drove off .
Only one passenger had alighted from the train and he too got lost somewhere in that darkness at the wink of an eye .
There was no sign of the ticket checker either .
When I came out on the street with my daughter Sharada the same stark darkness before the dawn was spread there also .
When we stood at the bus stand I felt as if the next moment someone would come with a pistol and run away with all our luggages .
Both of us immediately returned back to the station .
We started looking at the pictures of World War II , trophies etc . hung in the small room at the station .
Before coming to Italy whenever we mentioned about our proposed visit to Sicily to our acquaintances , there was same reaction . hey , why are you going to Sicily , do n't you know that it is the center of Mafia . .
And what is so great about Sicily .
In Sicily one thing Mafia and another one is Etna Volcano .
Both are dangerous .
This curiosity of everybody was natural .
As much as we know about Italy -LRB- Rome , Vatican , Venice , Leaning Tower of Pisa -RRB- the least we know about Sicily .
Sicily the largest island in the Mediterranean Sea has remained under the domination of many countries from the ancient time due to its military and commercial importance because of its geographical location .
Sicily is often referred to as the ` ball ' of the ` boot ' of Italy -LRB- because of its map -RRB- too .
Due to the influence of various civilizations and cultures a fascinating confluence of Greek , Roman , Spanish , African and Arabic can be seen in Sicily 's architechture and lifestyle .
First of all the tribes of Cylian , Siculiana , Illinium etc . started living in Sicily .
The Greeks arrived in Sicily in the 8th Century BC who founded the cities .
Cities like Syracuza -LRB- Syracuse -RRB- , Messina , Catania , Agrigento etc . grew rapidly in Sicily .
Rome conquered Sicily in 210 BC .
Following the division of Roman Empire Sicily became a part of Byzantium Empire .
The ` Arabics ' captured Sicily in 910 AD .
Roger I hoisted the ` Norman Flag ' in Sicily in 1060 .
After that Sicily was respectively ruled by Roman Empire -LRB- Holy Roman Empire -RRB- , France , Spain and Australia .
At the time of unification of Italy in 1860 Sicily was merged in Italy but its autonomy in the internal affairs continues .
The Independent Parliament of Sicily designs its own independent law .
After spending 1 hour at the station we reached to the bus stand again and by that time it had become quite bright .
A lady standing there assured us that the bus was about to come .
The bus arrived and climbing on the inaccessible hill terrain it took us to the summit in 45 minutes .
One can enjoy the tour of both the hill station and the sea beach in ` Taormina ' .
Hiking lovers can climb on ` Etna ' and ` Arab Fort ' .
People fond of sea sports can enjoy water-skiing , boating etc . at the beach .
We had breakfast at the bus terminus .
By that time the manager of the Guest House herself came to receive us .
We kept the luggage in the guest house and after bathing headed out for a walk .
The Greek Theatre built in the 3rd Century BC on the highest peak of the city is the major attraction of Taormina .
The Greek Theatre has been built under the open sky .
In the Greek Theatre half moon shaped stairs are made by cutting out rocks for the audience to sit and the theater is at the bottom .
The appearance of this stadium more than 2 thousand years old has changed several times .
Some Spanish Chieftain had made his house in this Greek Theatre .
The Roman rulers made it an arena for gladiator competitions .
Music concert , ballet dance , drama etc . are organized in the Greek Theatre even at present .
One can easily imagine how supernatural , how unique the pleasure and experience of dance and music sitting in the lap of Nature under the shade of moon and stars might be .
There are a Roman Theatre , big church , the fort built by the Arabs in the 11th century , museum and art gallery too in Taormina .
We did see some of these but frankly speaking nothing else impressed as much after seeing the ` Greek Theatre ' .
Etna ' is the world 's biggest and active volcano .
A new information we received is that a dormant volcano is more dangerous than an active volcano .
It is difficult to guess about dormant volcano when the volcano will explode and how terrible it will be .
On the other hand the active volcano constantly keeps on emitting smoke .
The chances of explosion of an active volcano being disastrous is less .
Our next stop was Syracuza or Syracuse .
Syracuza city was formed by the Corinth Gasis in 734 BC .
Within 200 years Syracuza city became so powerful that it became the eyesore of Athens State .
Every now and then there used to be war between both the states .
Once the Navy of Athens attacked from 3 sides with entire ship fleet .
But instead of winning the whole fleet of Athens went into the sea .
To go from Taormina to Syracuse we had to change bus at ` Catania ' the headquarters of ` Mafia ' .
The famous fountain of Catania , main Church and famous idol made of lava , running hastily we saw all .
We reached to Syracuse after the journey of 1 hour .
The bus terminus is in ` Ortigia island ' so we got down there itself .
Ortigia has been connected with the rest of the city through a bridge .
Apollo Temple ' of the sixth century BC is the oldest monument of the city .
But we saw nothing like Indian temple in the Apollo temple .
The broken base of 2 poles in a field surrounded by stones , some fractured stone statues and broken pieces were kept with utmost care .
There is a monument of St . Lucy at a short distance from this church .
It is a favorite place of the local residents as it is built on the sea-side .
The sea-side becomes very charming in the evenings .
There is a spring of sweet water here located merely 10 metres from the sea .
The wall of this part of Ortigia has been built by pushing the sea water behind as if an ocean fort .
There is a sitting arrangement of 6 thousand people in the western part of Syracuse .
When we descended from the hill with the theater we saw the caves built there in which prisoners and slaves used to break , cut and carve stones once upon a time .
Among these caves the mouth of the 23 metres high and 65 metres deep cave is very narrow .
Because of this strange creation the shape of this cave really looks like a human ear .
The sound echoes a lot in this cave .
It is said that the officers of the king atop the hill could clearly hear the conversation of the prisoners breaking stones in the cave below .
The ancient ` Roman Arena ' and the giant ` Stone Sacrifice Altar ' are the other attractions of this area .
Stone Sacrifice Altar ' in which 400 to 500 animals could be slaughtered together .
The stones of the arena had been uprooted to create the sea wall of Ortigia island .
It took us a long time to see the objects from ancient time to present time in Syracuse Museum .
Suddenly we got startled when we glanced the clock .
We took a taxi to reach to the bus stand and breathed a sigh of relief after reaching the guest house by 9 pm running around .
The next day we took leave from Taormina and arrived at Agrigento the ` Valley of the Temples ' .
Some girls of the guest house had warned us that these temples of Agrigento were very fragmented .
Yet these temples of Agrigento are counted among the world 's leading Greek temples .
When we took a bus from Rozali Square -LRB- Piazza Rozali -RRB- and arrived at Sicily 's capital ` Palermo ' it had become night .
Fortunately our hotel was near the bus stand itself and we easily located it out .
We were amused on reaching at the hotel .
Once upon a time this hotel must have been the house of a powerful priest , pundit or chieftain .
Wide marble staircase , large rooms with high ceilings , large balcony , soft and soothing mattresses and attached bathroom .
Usually this last feature is not available for people on medium-budget like us .
Norman kings had made Palermo the capital during their rule .
Some travelers and historians of the medieval period had counted Palermo as one of the most beautiful cities of Europe .
Cathedral ' the main church of Palermo is a magnificient building built in Norman style .
Geometric vines on the outer walls of Cathedral church reflect Arabic influence .
On one of the walls of the Cathedral church the verses of Quran have been carved .
The graves of Roger II , Henry VI and Fredric II are built in the Cathedral church .
The huge dome of Cathedral church was built in the 18th century .
Mosaic Art ' has been extensively used in the churches and palaces of Sicily .
In Mosaic art floors and walls are beautifully decorated by coloring small pieces and thin chips of stones with various colors and sticking them closely .
That place adorned with mosaic art appears as if a carpet has been layed or a panel has been hung .
The main square of Palermo city is called ` Quattro Canti ' -LRB- four corners -RRB- .
Same style of houses were built at the four corners in order to decorate the square .
The main gate of those houses and statues standing nearby are also similar .
The name of the fountains built at ` Pretoria Square ' of Palermo city was although Fontana Pretoria .
The citizens used to feel so ashamed to see the naked statues built at Pretoria Square that they started calling it ` Fountain of Rome ' or ` Fountain of Shame ' .
The construction of ` Santa Maria La Nuova ' church of Monreal only 8 kilometres far from Palermo was done by William II the grandson of Roger II in the last years of the 12th century .
Santa Maria La Nuova Church looking plain from outside looked normal from inside .
The 2 large gates of the church were built by 2 prominent architects of Italy out of which the middle gate is built of copper .
We did a bit of shopping after returning from Monreal and then got busy packing luggage on reaching at the hotel .
We were satisfied that the travel had concluded safely and happy that all the misunderstandings regarding Sicily had been cleared as well .
Earlier the capital of Marwar State was Mondor .
Ridmal ' founded Mondor by winning it with his own muscle power .
Ridmal 's son Jodha did not like Mondor .
Although Mondor city was settled on the high rocks of ` Vihangakut Mount ' .
There was dense forest all around Mondor city .
It was not easy for anyone to attack the fort of Mondor .
The whole Marwar State was visible from this hill .
The hill on which Jodha Mal established his own city in the 15th century .
It was named Jodhpur on Jodha Mal 's name itself .
The historic fort and palace of Jodhpur is the living example of royal pride of this city .
Jodhpur settled at the edge of the Thar desert is the second biggest city of Rajsthan .
Marwar Festival organised once a year is celebrated as a major cultural event of the city .
Kutch located in the North of Gujarat -LRB- Saurashtra -RRB- is full of the culture of caves .
Kutch connected with Pakistan is a border district .
The sea , mountains and desert of Kutch are spectacular .
So it is said that the aura of Gujarat is incomplete without seeing Kutch .
Kutch is the center of pink flamingoes , pelicans and Aneket Kavid birds and the inhabiting place of rare wild donkeys .
The local people of Kutch region still have their traditions and rituals which they have preserved for years on .
The beginning of 2007 was marked as India - Italy Friendship Year .
Various important agreements were concluded from the viewpoint of developing industrial , cultural , tourism and industrial sectors between the countries India and Italy .
Italy lies at the 5th place in the world tourism sector .
Along with the ruins of ancient Roman empire , grand skycrapers built in modern style can also be seen in the cities of Italy .
After seeing them it gives the impression as if the modern Italy is developing under the shade of giant banyan tree of ancient Roman civilization and culture .
As the result of rebirth during the Renaissance period of 1861 Italy is now a special attraction center for tourists all over the world in the form of ravishing in youth , rich country .
It is an indisputable fact that it is impossible to know the history of European civilization , culture without traveling to Italy .
Indeed the visit of Italy will be an exciting , informative , memorable and pleasant experience in itself .
Alitalia Airlines or Eurofly Air Service take direct flights to Rome the capital of Italy .
The moment one disembarks at Flumisini Airport of Rome the tourists ' misconception that one will not face any language related problem in any country in Europe if he knows English language gets cleared .
Miles far away from English language the residents of Italy know and speak their National language ` Italian ' only .
So as not to face this difficulty as far as possible while traveling under a travel package therefore the travel agencies have their own personal interpreters .
While going alone or with family to Italy either you have to take an interpreter along or quietly complete the journey by reading guidebook .
Tourists are eager to learn the history of Rome after arriving at Rome .
Keeping this in mind the history of Italy from the ancient Roman Empire till date has been depicted in the ' 4-Dimensional Time Elevator ' .
While watching this the audience sitting in the 4-Dimensional Time Elevator start feeling themselves connected with that history .
City of Rome is famous for fountains and monuments .
The grand stone statues standing at each square of Rome and fountains flowing at every step are seen welcoming the tourists .
The moment the name of fountains crops up we recall the famous ` Fontana de Tracy ' .
There are various routes to enter the city from the ancient demolished walls itself built for the protection of Rome .
There are graves of famous poets Kitts and Shelley in the ` Protestant Cemetery ' near San Paolo entrance in Rome .
The atrocious and dreaded emperors of Rome were Nero and Caligula .
Depressed with the atrocities Caligula was assassinated by his own bodyguards .
While Nero the Emperor of Rome had committed suicide .
Later in order to wipe out the memories of horrific atrocities of those emperors the Emperor named Vespasian converted their Venetian Palace into a huge amphitheatre ` Colosseum ' .
It was ironic that the slaves had to fight with ferocious lions for entertainment in the amphitheatre .
Finally the lion would tear the slave into pieces and the audience used to dance with happiness .
The Colosseum is still standing holding in itself the sighs of slaves .
Besides these the tomb of Victor Emmanuel and the ancient ruins of Roman Forum are worth seeing in Rome .
The beautiful buildings and magnificient Venetian Palace built during Renaissance period on Kapitalin hill designed by Michelangelo from the balcony of which the dictator Mussolini used to address the public is also worth visting .
In Rome there are innumerable churches and most of the churches have the graves of martyrs .
Vatican City is an autonomous country within another country .

That is why Florence is the richest cultural center in the world .
Florence City has been the land of action of famous painters , sculptors and architects like Michelangelo , Leonardo Da Vinci , Beticilly , Raphael , Giotto , Sellini .
The buildings built in Gothic style between the 13th and 16th century and Barrack style during Renaissance period are particularly spectacular in Florence .
Other attractions of Florence are Uffizi Museum and Pitti Museum .
Worth seeing in these museums are the rare , priceless paintings of world famous artists .
Ponte Vecchio ' stretches over Arno river .
There are small shops built by the roadside along the bank of Arno river .
Only this bridge was left undestroyed during the World War II .
Dante ' had been deported from the country here itself due to mutual hostility of Galfus and GibElaine .
Nearby Florence only is the small town of ` Pisa ' .
Pisa is the birthplace of great scientist ` Galileo ' .
Here itself is the worldfamous Wonder ` Leaning Tower ' of Pisa .
It was constructed as a ` Clock Tower ' in the 14th century along with the church made of white marble between 1174 - 1350 .

These bridges are like common lanes of other cities .
Piazza San Marco can be accessed from Grand Canal by steam boat from the railway station .
Countless number of pigeons keep on sitting in the huge courtyard infront of St . Mark Church on Piazza San Marco .
Nearby St . Mark 's Church itself is the Venetian Palace of the medieval rulers of Venice and the Bridge of Sighs .
The prisoners used to go to the jail through this bridge taking sighs .
For this reason the name of this bridge became Bridge of Sighs .
The attractive ` Gondola ' standing in the Grand Canal under Rialto Bridge attracts tourists towards itself .
it is essential to check your pocket before enjoying Gondola ride so that your budget is not disturbed .
The Gondola 's fare can be up to 100 euros per person .
A stroll in Venice on foot or by a steam boat is more beneficial for the pocket .
The trip to Venice will be considered half done without seeing Murano Island .
Steam boat is available from ` Pyre ' to go to Murano Island .
In Murano Island there is footpath built at both sides of the canal and along that are beautiful buildings .
On the ground floor of most of the buildings in Murano Island are the shops of glass toys , beautiful artifacts and utensil shops , everything of glass .

The train had reached Katni earlier , but on 14 January , we got the train to Prayag after five o'clock .
In the morning hours we were moving on the way from Kaushambhi to Dakshinapath through Tripuri , Jabalpur .
Our train was moving towards Prayag carrying the crowd of both Makar Sankranti and Somwari Amavasya .
We arrived at Prayag by eleven o'clock and this time our halt was at the house of Pundit Vrajmohan Vyas .
Pundit Vrajmohan was the Executive officer of Municipality at that time .
Vyasji had gone to Banaras , we learned that he had waited for our arrival .
Now we had to stay in Prayag for a few days .
We got off at ` Mughalsarai ' to catch the train to Banaras .
We found Shri Chetsingh Jaiswal and Kshirod Babu going towards the train to Patna in Mughalsarai .
They were returning from their leisure walk now .
On reaching at Banaras after sunset we became the guests of Dr . Mangal Dev Shastri .
In Dr . Mangal Dev Shastri 's house too the walls had cracked at some places due to the earthquake .
The impact of earthquake on the houses of Banaras , as it appears , was more than Prayag .
We got a special edition of ` Leader ' on 18th from which some confirmed news about partial devastation of North Bihar were received .
Three hundred people died in Darbhanga city due to earthquake .
The death toll due to earthquake in Muzaffarpur city reached up to one thousand .
56 people died in Patna because of the earthquake .
From Patna to Raxaul the land on the sides has sunken due to the earthquake .
Due to the earthquake at many places in Muzaffarpur and Champaran districts water has come out from inside the earth .
Hot water has come out in Patna after the earthquake .
I got down at Bankipur station after sunset .
Jayaswalji ran and embraced .
He had come from Ajmer on receiving wire message for some trial and stayed in Darbhanga during the earthquake .
However the people coming to Bankipur had understood that he too had been sacrificed in the earthquake .
The people coming to Bankipur did not get way to come or go anywhere for two days .
All of a sudden they caught some motor car and reached Barauni and came to Patna crossing the Ganges .
The reports of the earthquake were still in the air .
The knowledgeable astrologers of the country were saying that they had already done prediction for it and still more earthquakes would be occuring .
The thrust of earthquake gets a chance to make less damage due to wooden frame .
Perhaps the arches not being in use as much in our this zone is also because of the fear of the earthquake .
Wherever Jayswalji had put arch in his mansion , all the places had developed cracks due to the earthquake .
At night we crossed the Ganges by steamer and marched to board the train for Muzaffarpur at the other side .
Pundit Jawaharlalji had arrived at Patna hearing the news of earthquake in Bihar and was traveling by the same steamer .
One gentleman had already been sent to Hajipur so that he would keep a motor car ready for Muzaffarpur .
It was quite dark when we arrived at Hajipur .
After running around quickly we got a taxi for sixteen rupees for 31 miles .
The road was soft which was also broken at several places , so the motor had no space to run everywhere .
The impact of earthquake was completely visible on the houses on the way .
The water that had come out from the ground had collected in the form of lake .
We arrived at Muzaffarpur town observing all these .
What to talk of the earthquake play at Muzaffarpur .
People were camping in the fields of Muzaffarpur and lying .
The building of the court had broken in Muzaffarpur .
In Muzaffarpur the injured were kept in the huts prepared outside the hospital .
People had left their homes and camped in the campus of Chandwara , Darbhanga - Tinkuthia .
Grains and blankets were being distributed by the Government in Muzaffarpur .
I spotted two dead bodies being taken out from the debris and carried outside infront of me .
The Lal Kothi of Muzaffarpur was also destroyed .
There was no house left in Muzaffarpur which did not suffer any damage .
The earthquake had some special enmity with the towers of the temples and mosques of Muzaffarpur .
During the earthquake the land in Sitamarhi started cracking like a cucumber , stream of water also burst out at various places there .
The water flooded because of this .
At some places this crack had gone far into the ground .
At some places water came out of the ground like a fountain and heaped around the water mouth like sand-dome as the mouth of volcano .
The land of Sitamarhi we were going to , there the land had become like sieve with these water currents .
Millions of tons of sand had surfaced from the groove of the earth .
If only water and not sand had come out from the earth the terrible condition caused due to flood of water would not have happened .
The sand had bridged many fields of Sitamarhi .
No idea how much land of Sitamarhi will remain uncultivable for how long due to this .
Lot of sand was lying in the fields of Jhapha , sugar mills and the mills too had suffered a lot of damage .
We came by one-horse-cart for eight miles -LRB- Dharmpur -RRB- .
Some concrete houses were damaged due to earthquake in Chhapra .
There were Judge Kothi , Dutch Kothi , Panchmandir and several houses of Katra in Chhapra .
The Dutch Kothi of Chhapra had certainly become headless due to earthquake .
No building was destroyed in Chhapra .
We left for ` Majhi ' by twelve o'clock train .
We stayed at Babu Rajballabh 's place in Majhi .
Majhi is at the side of Sarayu river .
Chhapra district is in the middle of Sarayu and Gandak rivers .
Bhagirathi -LRB- Ganga -RRB- River flows in the south of Chhapra .
The impact of earthquake on the coast of Sarayu was the same as we had seen at Allahabad at the time of earthquake .
A couple of houses in Majhi were torn .
We went towards the old fort of Majhi -LRB- Usrain -RRB- .
We thought , some land might have torn in the old fort , so we might find any archaeological tableau .
Statue of Buddha of Prague-Muslim era was found in the old fort of Majhi .
The ancientness of this fort is proven by this statue .
This fort of Majhi has now been abandoned for many centuries because no sign of wall or life etc . is found beyond this .
The square land of this fort of Majhi is cultivated at present .
There is a way for water flow near the Eastern end of the fort .
Various shapes and sizes of bricks are found in this .
Some sandal trees were found at the same place of this canal at the Eastern end of Majhi fort .
Vaidyaraj Ramraksh , whom we used to call Tun-Tun had been appointed here as a physician by the District Board for some time now .
Vaidyaraj Ramraksh had found out this sandal .
When Vaidyaraj Ramraksh told me initially . could not believe it .
Sandal belongs to Malayagiri , how is its presence possible here .
When I went there myself and smelled it , what could be the reason to deny it .
At the same moment I rememebered things written by Kashikchandan in Pali script .
Just across the other side of Saraju visible in front was the Kashi country .
This sandal of Majhi indicated that at some point of time there used to be good sandal in Kashi .
I can not compare the fragrance , but the smell of the wood there was very nice .
The way from Chhapra to Banaras used to pass through the bridge of Majhi .
The earthquake had broken the bridge of Majhi so the train could not run on that .
The company had brought a ship by which people used to cross over .
The trains of both sides used to come and stand at the sides .
As the railway bridge of Majhi was broken we boarded the ship after reaching the banks .
The ship used to start from extreme East and bank at the extreme West .
After crossing ` Saraju ' we came to the erstwhile combined state and present Uttar Pradesh .
Saraju is the border of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar .
A strange unruliness is seen in Saraju too due to non-formation of linguistically based provinces .
We arrived at Sultanganj -LRB- Bhagalpur -RRB- on 8th March .
Initially we felt irritation in our throat in Sultanganj .
Actually we had been coughing for many days but we were thinking that the reason behind it was the earthquake water of Sitamarhi .
While going to Sultanganj Jamalpur came on our way .
The houses of Jamalpur were severely damaged by the earthquake .
On 9th March we went out to take a tour of Sultanganj .
The bunglow of Kumar Krishnanandji which was over the fort , had fallen due the earthquake .
Krishnanandji had built a new house , its walls too had slightly cracked .
We returned to Sultanganj again at night and reached at Patna on 11th March .
On 20th March we left from Sultanganj with Dharmakirti for Tibet .
On 21st March at six o'clock in the morning we got off at Siliguri station and booked a taxi for two rupees and reached Kalimpong .
Dharmakirti vomitted several times on the way .
The trip ahead is a part of our second trip to Tibet .

Our program was to see the famous Lake Manyara National Park while returning from Ngorongoro National Park .
We could not resist the desire of seeing Olduvai Valley , located in the East of Ngorongoro Conservation Area , one of the world 's most important sites in terms of archaeology .
The skull of about 1 ,75 ,0000 years old human ancestor was found in Olduvai Valley , the credit of which goes to Dr . Leakey .
Archaeological discoveries of Dr . Leakey have worldwide reputation .
These days that skull is stored in the National Museum of Dar-Es-Salam .
The fossilized residues of the animals extinct several years ago which were discovered in the same area are stored in the museum built near Olduvai Valley .
On seeing this museum we started sinking into the atmosphere of millions of years before .
We all enjoyed seeing the fossils a lot .
Now we started worrying about entering into the Lake Manyara National Park .
The day was ending and there was little time .
Yet the desire to see Lake Manyara National Park was getting stronger .
We certainly did not want to miss the opportunity of seeing Manyara Park as it was 19 kilometers down from the Gornagoro Park .
There was half an hour left for the last entry .
Thanks to the driver we had reached to Lake Manyara National Park in time .
We breathed a sigh of relief as soon as the jeep entered the Lake Manyara National Park .
Lake Manyara National Park is situated about 120 kilometres away in the Southwest of ` Arusha ' .
The beautiful view of 305 metres tall Western wall of the Great Rift Valley can be seen from here .
Infact the Great Rift Valley is that part of the transformation formed on the Earth 's upper surfaces which is spread over wide area from Turkey to Kenya .
This transformation gets divided in the Eastern and Western parts in Kenya .
Lake Manyara National Park is situated in the Eastern part .
The word Manyara is supposed to have originated from a plant named ` Euphorbia Tirurviea Tirucalli ' .
The people of Masai tribe use this plant to make fence around their houses .
At some point of time Manyara was the favorite hunting ground of professional hunters but now it has changed into a beautiful National Park .
Although Manyara National Park is spread over only 324 square kilometres in terms of area but its versatile wild estate bears altogether a different feature .
Manyara Lake is spread over approximately 229 square metres .
There is dense forest on the banks of Manyara Lake .
We wanted to see the maximum in minimum time .
In Lake Manyara National Park , first of all we got to see wild pig and wild cat .
The long teeth of the pigs were making them horrific .
The power of pigs is vested in their teeth only .
On several occasions the pig gathers courage to confront even a tiger with the help of these teeth .
We were mesmerized by seeing hundreds of hippopotamuses lying in the Manyara lake .
Some hippopotamuses were also walking outside the Manyara Lake .
Soon after walking for some distance into the Manyara park we encountered a herd of elephants moving around in the bushes .
Then suddenly we spotted baboons in the Manyara Park .
There is a large number of baboons in Lake Manyara Park .
Baboons are called ` judges ' in Swahili .
Due to the geographical location of Lake Manyara National Park two types of species of baboons are found here .
Yellow baboons are in the Southeast and Olive baboons in the Northwest of Tanzania .
In Lake Manyara Park such hybrid baboons are present which have traits of both the species mentioned above .
We were surprised to see some baboons sitting alert on trees on the high branches .
We were told that the baboons do like this when they sense danger .
The baboons get down from the trees after the danger is gone .
These baboons were sleeping on the trees in Manyara Park .
Baboons select their favorite tree to sleep .
Now we were anxious to see the lions resting on the trees of Manyara Park .
I had read that like the famous ` Serengeti National Park ' the lions and leopards in Lake Manyara too have the unique habit of resting on trees which is not found in any other National Park in the world .
Lions can often be seen sitting and comfortably dozing off on the branches of Akesia trees at a height of 15-20 feet in Manyara National Park .
There are many logics behind this habit of the lions . few reasons as cited are to avoid flies , to enjoy the breeze , to keep an eye on the herds of zebras and buffaloes passing by , to keep safe from the herds of elephants .
I was just thinking about the strange habit of lions resting on the trees in several National parks of East Africa when suddenly the driver stopped the jeep and pointed us towards a tree .
We were stunned to see two long tails hanging down .
When we turned our neck upwards we found two giant lions resting on the tree .
For a while we kept on enjoying this beautiful and exciting scene breathtakingly .
We were surprised to see the skulls , horns and skeletons lying at several places .
These bones must be that of the wild animals which might have become the prey of the lions and leopards .
The lions in Manyara Park mostly prey on buffaloes , zebras and wild beasts for food .
The lions in Manyara Park mostly prey on buffaloes , zebras and wild beasts for food .
Like other parks of East Africa we saw large mud molehills of termites at several places in Manyara National Park too .
These termites are also called brown ants in several areas .
But these termites of Manyara Park are neither brown nor they are ants .
These termites are the primitive species of insects connected with cockroaches at some level .
Termites are called Machawa in Swahili .
While seeing the rich resource of wild animals of Manyara National Park we arrived at the grassy land between Masasa and Chem rivers .
We chanced upon the opportunity of seeing zebras again in this grassy land .
Zebra . shy animal with black stripes on white body , is called Punda Milia -LRB- striped donkey -RRB- in Swahili .
No doubt the appearance of zebra somehow resembles a donkey .
Zebras often become the prey of lions .
Lions savor zebra 's flesh the most .
On an average zebras live for 12 years .
According to wildlife scientists zebra 's lifespan can be 30 years too .
Zebras are the pride of East Africa .
When excited , zebras produce sound like barking .
Zebras found in Manyara are of ` Equus Burchelli ' species as defined by the Burchell .
Elephants are as such mostly found at several places in the park but being wandering creatures they also go to the jungles of nearby ` Nadala Basin ' .
Nadala Basin , where the elephant research camp is located .
Elephant is an important part of the abundant wild treasure of Manyara National Park .
We encountered a herd of elephants while moving around in Lake Manyara National Park .
Children enjoyed watching two tiny elephant calves walking along with the herd of elephants a lot .
The height of an elephant at the time of birth is only 80 cm .
Those two little elephants must have been about 1 metre tall .
The age of those tiny elephants must have been just a few months old .
In order to protect their cubs from lions and other animals elephants keep them right in the middle .
The African elephant -LRB- Loxodonta Africana -RRB- which is called ` Tembo sa Dovu ' in Swahili is slightly larger than the Asian elephant .
The ears of the African elephants are also big .
Lake Manyara National Park is the haven for more than almost 400 elephants .
We had just walked a bit in the park when three to four elephants came out of the bushes and stood infront .
The jeep had to be stopped but engine was kept running .
The driver told that we had to wait until the elephants voluntarily walked away from there .
We were in a fix .
Evening had begun to darken .
The twitter of birds was increasing .
Birds were returning to their nests .
Fortunately after some time the elephants moved away from our path walking in an intoxicated manner .
An elephant made a loud scream .
It is said about the elephants that they make contact with other fellow elephants located miles away by producing some special kind of sound .
Nowadays research has been going on about the sounds of elephants .
Many a times the male elephants fight with each other on the issue of developing relation with the female elephants .
We kept on watching the elephants disappearing in the bushes quietly .
Just as we arrived at ` Bagayo Basin ' we got an opportunity to see black rhinoceroses -LRB- Diceros Bicornis -RRB- .
Black rhinoceros known as ` Kifaru ' in Swahili language is found not only in the Bagayo Basin but also in the other areas of the park .
The black rhinoceros weighing two tonnes gets violent any moment and does not even hesitate to attack the vehicles and harm them .
Black rhinoceroses have an intense auditory and olfactory sense .
But the visual sense of black rhinoceroses is equally weak .
Even the lion , the king of jungle , considers it rather safe to parry away from a fully grown black rhinoceros .
White rhinoceroses which are found in the Northwestern Uganda and Southern Sudan are not present in the Lake Manyara National Park .
Though the names indicate a difference , but the color of both the species of rhinoceros is more or less brown beige .
The mouth of white rhinoceros is squarish more suited for grazing grass while the mouth -LRB- or snout -RRB- of black rhinoceros is somewhat pointed .
There are several legends about the horn of rhinoceros popular among the African people .
The horn , which is not a horn but actually a hard bunch of hair , is useful in medicine in the opinion of Africans .
Although scientists have proven that this is only a myth , but many rhinoceros in Africa have had to lose their lives in past due to these and many other myths .
Now the situation has improved .
More than 50 black rhinoceros are enriching the Lake Manyara National Park .
We were surprised to see a huge pile of animal dung at one place in the Lake Manyara Park .
We came to know that it was the dung of rhinoceroses .
We were told that rhinoceroses have a strange habit of passing stool at a fixed location .
Many legends related to this fact are popular among the African people .
The view of Lake Manyara looks beautiful from between the Bagayo and Andibash rivers due to the height .
We were admiringly watching the beautiful scene of Lake Manyara .
Manyara Lake situated at a height of 945 metres from the sea level and spread over 229 square kilometres is a paradise for nature lovers .
The water level of Manyara Lake keeps on changing every year .
There are various types of fishes in Manyara Lake .
Cat fish , Clarias , Bream and Tilapia are the main in Manyara Lake .
A lot of conch shells and shells were lying at the banks of Lake Manyara .
Unpolished . conch shell picked up from the bank of Lake Manyara is still present with me in its original form and reminds me of those golden moments .
Our desire to see the tallest animal on earth giraffe had not been fulfilled yet .
There is considerably good number of giraffes in Lake Manyara National Park .
We were about to return from the Manyara National Park when our search was complete .
Some giraffes taking out their long tongues were satisfying their hunger with the leaves of nearby trees .
I had an immense satisfaction to see giraffe the beautiful National animal of Tanzania .
The happiness of children had no bounds .
As a matter of fact we all had seen giraffe for the first time .
There are star like spots on the bodies of giraffes found in Lake Manyara .
Whereas there are net like spots on the bodies of giraffes found in the Southern Kenya and other places .
Giraffe -LRB- Giraffa Camelopardalis -RRB- is called ` Twiga ' in Swahili .
Regarding its biological nomenclature the zoological scientists have the opinion that giraffe is probably a hybrid species made from the combination of camel and leopard .
While walking giraffes raise both the legs on one side and move forward like camels .
The extremely long neck of giraffe helps it to eat the leaves located at a height on Akesia trees .
Contrary to the popular belief giraffe sleeps lying down but the neck is upright .
We reached at ` Maji Moto ' in the final stage of visiting Lake Manyara National Park .
There are hot water springs in Maji Moto .
The water coming out of the earth 's womb at 60 degrees centigrade is the symbol of amazing powers of the nature .
Hot water comes out from the infinitive depth of the earth through the contours of rocks .
I remembered Sohna hot waterfall and Tattapani hot waterfall of my country .
We were surprised to see different kinds of algae -LRB- kai -RRB- developed in hot water .
We were at the Southern end of Lake Manyara National Park .
There was no exit door at the Southern end of the park .
So we had to return to the Northern exit gate .
We returned with the memories of beautiful picturesque of extremely rich wild animal treasure cherished in our heart .
Evening was growing .
The sun was about to sink .
The golden rays of the setting sun was giving reddish tinge to the water of Manyara Lake .
This was an extremely beautiful view of Manyara Lake never to be forgotten .
The rays falling on the fishes peeking out of water or jumping in the Manyara Lake were giving them a supernatural and marvellous aura .
I wanted to absolutely assimilate that unbelievable scene .
The time was getting over .
The Sun God had set by the time we returned .
Slowly it was getting dark .
Staying inside the Manyara Park any longer was no less than dangerous .
It is completely prohibited for the tourists to stay inside the park after seven o'clock .
While returning we saw several species of birds too .
Various birds including different species of cranes , ducks , woodpeckers are an integral part of the famous Lake Manyara Park .
Our heart started jumping with excitement on seeing the herd -LRB- row -RRB- of deers of ` Impala ' species just as we were heading for the exit gate .
It is rare to get such a good luck in the final stage .
This beautiful animal known as ` Swalapala ' in Swahili language was doubling the beauty of this park .
This deer of Impala species grazes as well as eats leaves and buds .
This beautiful deer found in the Southern and Eastern Africa is an expert in taking long jump .
This deer is called ` Zulu ' in South Africa .
Zulu is capable of taking 10 feet high and 30 feet long jumps .
While coming towards the entrance gate I was silently watching this extremely beautiful wild animal called ` Swalapala ' or ` Zulu ' galloping .
We took a glance at the Lake Manyara Park for the last time and came out of the park with a heavy heart .
Night had become dark .
After bathing in the beauty of this Lake Manyara National Park enriched with famous and enchanting sceneries we were returning with a wet heart .
I was thinking that the nature has offered a precious treasure of natural wealth in abundance to this country of East Africa with relatively poor but stable economy .
The jeep was running fast towards Arusha .
A strange emotion filled my heart .
Eyelashes got moist .
I rolled down the jeep 's window pane .
My tired and heavy eyelashes started to shut down due to the cold breeze .
My mind was also running fast along with the jeep . felt as if something was left behind .
Participating in an adventurous activity has become a part of today 's adventurous lifestyle even if it means taking part in a marathon .
Even if there is no real adventure people do not lose any chance to enjoy the adventure through mobile , computer and video game .
Whether real or virtual , there is no dearth of opportunities for adventure either .
We say that it is great to have adventure .
In favor of this thing we do not even forget to count the names of those who stand out in trekking , paragliding , skydiving , base jumping , surfing and mountaineering .
There is no doubt that being adventurous means being brave .
So people do not miss out any opportunity to call themselves adventurous .
The straighforward meaning of adventure is , when you do something different breaking the routine life .
It is interesting that every person has his own different lookout about adventure .
In fact the meaning of adventure is a game , merryment or some social concern under which you do something that gives you pleasure and your courage is also exhibited .
If we see from this perspective people are really getting adventurous .
There is no dearth of people who have the guts to travel from Kanyakumari to Kashmir by car .
Adventurous people have the courage to go to Kashmir even during the days of winter .
Such programs become a part of the lifestyle of adventurous people .
Various institutions made for adventure games are also proving to be extremely helpful to the people in this regard .
As per the plan , these troops of Saadat Khan and Mir Bakshi would gherao the batallion of Peshwa between Mathura and Vrindavan .
But the batallion of Maratha Peshwa Baji Rao marched before they reached there .
Peshwa Baji Rao swiftly captured the Kalkaji Temple built outside Delhi and camped there .
The troops sent by King Mohammed Shah reached near Kalkaji Temple following Peshwa Bai Rao .
Peshwa Baji Rao sneaked towards Talkatora -LRB- garden -RRB- with his army .
The dream of Peshwa Baji Rao of grabbing Delhi did not fulfill .
Yes , Peshwa Baji Rao did major harm to 700 Mughal soldiers and infantries .
Similarly Jaswant Rao Holkar too had attacked Delhi in 1805 and camped in the campus of Kalkaji temple .
The Kalkaji Temple of Delhi was the active center of Hindu activities during the Mutiny of 1857 and Indo Pak partition of 1947 .
There has always been co-existence of diverse cultures , traditions and lifestyles in the world .
The human curiosity towards these variations takes him from one place to another even if it is related to religion , language , tradition , food habit , architecture or natural environment .
For this same reason our country full of diversity is often attracting the tourists across the world today .
There is Himalayan range on the peninsular earth of India .
In India there is Thar desert , green forests , back waters of Kerala and oceans of unfathomable depth at the three sides .
There is a lot in these geographical features of India that draws foreign tourists here .
The magnificient architechture in the form of ancient forts , palaces , havelis and temples attract the foreign tourists to India the most .
According to tour operators like Cox and King the buildings of historical and archaeological importance introduce them to our rich history .
The foreign tourists try to understand the royal lifestyle of the time through the forts , palaces and heritage hotels .
They enjoy royal travel on the luxury trains like Palace on Wheel and Royal Rajasthan .
Besides the great architechture of Khajuraho , Konark , Mahabalipuram , Hampi , Badami , Thanjavur , the caves of Ajanta-Ellora impress them a lot .
The beauty hidden in the stone art and sculptures there entice them .
The other attraction for foreign tourists are our spectacular beaches spread over miles long coastlines .
The foreign tourists enjoy the ` sun , surf and sand ' at these beaches .
There is no dearth of tourists changing the color of their skin by taking in the sun rays after bathing in the sea .
That is the reason all the beaches of Kovalam , Mahabalipuram , Visakhapatnam and Goa are always thronged by foreign tourists .
There are also several adventure destinations for foreign tourists .
The group of islands of Lakshadweep and Andaman and Nicobar are ideal destinations for adventure sports like scuba diving and para sailing .
But the tourists prefer going to snowy valleys of Gulmarg , Solang and Auli for snow sports adventure .
There is no dearth of ideal destinations for river rafting , rock climbing , paraglaiding either in India .
The wildlife sanctuary and bird sanctuary etc . of India are synonymous to excitement both for foreign and Indian tourists .
Foreign tourists go to the mountainous places of India only for adventure .
For local tourists the hill stations are the destinations for spending holidays amidst natural beauty away from the city buzz .
Huge crowds of local people are seen at all the hill stations during the summer season .
There are several pilgrimages too in the mountains .
There is movement of pilgrims at the pilgrimages all year round .
This is the reason the percentage of religious tourism is the highest in local tourism in India .

Among these travels the skycraper Gopuram of the temples and the colored images attached to them in South India mesmerize even the foreign tourists .
The foreigners coming to India with regards to religion often come to Buddhist destinations .
The major destinations for tourists of Japan , Thailand and Sri Lanka are the well known Buddhist destinations Sarnath , Kushinagar , Bodhgaya , Sanchi , Amravati and Dharmashala .
Some foreign tourists find solace with the darshan of Krishna 's life at Vrindavan , Mathura .
Some foreign tourists find spiritual peace by staying in the ashrams of Rishikesh .
Tourists also go to Auroville near Pondicherry and Osho Ashram of Poona for peace .
Like spiritual peace a large number of tourists also visit here for physical benefit .
There are various world famous destinations of natural medicine , yoga and spa therapy etc . in our country for acquiring energy .
There are several such places in Kerala and Uttarakhand .
As compared to Indian tourists more foreign tourists come to these places of India .
Kerala for Natural Medicine and Rishikesh for Yoga are world famous destinations .
There is a lot of importance of fairs and festivals in our country 's multicoloured culture .
Foreign tourists can be seen taking part in the Pushkar Fair and Desert Festival of Rajasthan , Dance Festival of Khajuraho and Mahabalipuram , Ladakh Festival .
Foreigners too can be seen participating in Hampi Festival of Karnataka , Rath Yatra Festival of Orissa , Boat Race Festival of Kerala .
A new dimension of Eco Tourism has started in our country in the form of Village Tourism a few years ago .
Apart from the rich tourists of our country , Village Tourism has been immensely liked by foreign tourists .
The attraction of Home Stay has also joined with the village tourism .
On the other side our country has also made its identity as corporate tourism destination .
There are world level convention centres in several cities of India .
Not only this , due to a different identity formation of Indian designers in the global fashion world about a decade ago the fashion tourism had started here .
Since then several big fashion event and shows like Mr . International have been hosted in India .
Through them inbound tourism has grown continuously in the country of India .
With the Commonwealth Games being organized in the coming year Indian Tourism will get more boost .
It is hoped that India will emerge as destination with diversity .
Vijaya Dashami i . . Dussehra festival , celebrated as a symbol of the victory of the truth over the untruth and the good over the bad , is a major festival of North India .
In the staging of Ramlilas running for nine days the life sketch of Lord Rama is shown .
On the day of Dussehra the effigies of Ravana , Kumbhakarna and Meghnada are burnt .
Thousands of visitors come to see Ramlila .
This festival ends with the acclaim of Lord Ram .
The Dussehra of Kullu -LRB- Himachal Pradesh -RRB- also has a special place of its own .
Statues of deities from different temples of the province are brought with extreme reverence in palanquins and dolis to Shri Raghunath Temple of Kullu .
There is a custom of special worship in Kullu .
On the occasion of Dussehra a huge fair is also held in the field of Kullu .
It is spectacular to the decorated shops , the courage of children , women , men and elders dressed in colorful dresses .
On the occasion of Dussehra there stays a stir of music and folk dance in Kullu .
Starting from Dussehra this festival of Kullu runs for a week .
The form of Dussehra celebrated in Jagdalpur of Bastar district of Chattishgarh state is a bit different .
The Shobha Yatra of Maa Danteshwari the founding goddess of the state holds the chief center of attraction of Dussehra .
On the occasion of Dussehra the doli of Mother Danteshwar is brought from Dantewada to Jagdalpur .
After worship in Jagdalpur it is seen off for Dantewada .
Dussehra is a major festival of Bastar residents .
Tribals from all the nook and corners of Bastar region come to participate in the merrimaking festival of Dussehra .
It is said that in 15th century the fourth king of Kakatia dynasty Purushottam Dev had started the Dussehra festival in Bastar .
The Dussehra of Mysore of Karnataka is celebrated in a different style .
It is said that the Dussehra of Mysore started as a symbol of victory of Chamundi Devi over the demon Mahishasur .
On this occasion a royal demonstration proceeds from the palaces of Rajmahal .
In this procession of Mysore besides different glimpses the decorated elephants are center of special attraction .
On the day of Navami after the prayer from the Juloos Palace this procession reaches Banni Mandap through major roads of the cities .
At night in Banni Mandap the torch parade and the attractive rhythms of the police band charm the minds of the gathered crowd of people .
In West Bengal after the prayers running for nine days on Dussehra there is a tradition of dispersing honourably the statues of Mother Durga in the ocean and the rivers .
Come today we will tell you about the Trishul mountain peak .
You must have seen the statues of Lord Shankar and His pictures several times .
In them you must have seen His weapon trident .
The name of a snow peak located in the mountain ranges of the Himalaya is based on the same trident .
You would think whether this peak looks like trident ?
Trishul Peak though does look like trident , but like trident it does have three peaks .
These are called trident one , trident two and trident three .
The highest trident is trident one .
The height of Trident One from the sea level is 7 ,120 metres .
Second and Third peaks are respectively 6 ,690 metres and 6 ,007 metres .
To tell you one more thing , all these three peaks are joined together through a ridge .
Trishul Peak is located in the Bageshwar district of Uttarakhand .
Bageshwar is in the western part of Kumaun .
This peak is considered sacred in Bageshwar .
You know , initially when there were attempts to climb this peak then the porters there used to forbid to climb the Trishul Peak .
In their eyes Trishul Peak is a sacred and worshipped mountain peak .
After several attempts the first attempt to reach Trishul Peak was made in 1907 .
Then T . . Longstaff along with two other mountaineers , some guides and porters had become successful in touching this peak .
He had chosen the way of snow river through valley .
On the way he also had to face some snowy storms at some places but he never gave up .
One special thing is that Trishul was the highest peak then among the snow peaks of the Himalayas .
That is when the man won it there was no other peak higher than Trishul touched by man .
To tell you one more interesting thing , in 1987 in a campaign of Yugoslavia mountaineers had crossed the ridges of all the three peaks together .
During the climb of the mountains at some places they also had to cross mountains like walls of snow .
For this these mountaineers had to climb while making way in the snow through axe .
It is surprising that two members of this campaign had done paragliding from the Trishul Peak .
For mountaineering on Trishul group one has to go to Base camp in Kumaun through Almora , Kausani , Gualdam , Debal , Bedini Bugyal and Rupkund .
You know that every person can not do mountaineering .
Every person has the desire to see this sacred peak of the Himalaya .
Therefore if you wish to see the pleasant form of Trishul Peak then you can go to Kausani .
There are several view points in Kausani from where Trishul Snow Peak can be viewed .
Just think when you see all the three snow covered peaks of the Trishul Mountain Peak you will also wish to be a mountaineer .
At that time the most direct way of the travel to Bengal from Manipur used to go through Kachaar .
Bhagyachandra also wanted to use the same way .
The king of Kachaar could not accept this .
He got two messengers of the king killed and also warned him of bad consequences .
In this situation Maharaj Bhagyachandra had to move towards Shrihatt -LRB- Silhat -RRB- by catching the route of southern forest .
This way of Shrihatt was so difficult that the elephant could not be ridden there .
The king had to ride on the horse back .
British officer , Francis Hamilton , has reported in Account of Assam the number of people going in this journey along with King Bhagyachandra to be seven hundred .
In this journey of Bhagyachandra the carriers themselves were three hundred .
The narration of this journey of King Bhagyachandra was written on the initiative of Lavanyachandra .
Navchand , Haricharan and Madhavrao Vahed Ba told the details of this journey to Khagendra Minaba , Haricharan Khagemba , Veermani Loremba and Khodchon Ahaiba .
Together they prepared this travelogue of Bhagyachandra .
In the published form of this travelogue at the end of the book the editor has also given the meaning of difficult words alphabetically .
With this understanding this travelogue for the usual readers of the present form of Manipuri language has become easy .
The credit of laying the foundation of modern Manipuri Travelogue Literature goes to a travel article of Hijam Iravat published in 1937 AD .
Titled Mandlegi Khong Fam -LRB- The journey of Mandley -RRB- this article is the detail of the journey done by Iravat to participate in the third convention of Nikhil Hindu Maniputi Mahasabha held in Mandley the same year from 28 February to March .
This journey had started from Vattagram by ship on 18 February , 1937 .
Iravat paid special attention towards the thing that hotels in the ship were after the names of Hindu and Muslim -LRB- Hindu Hotel , Musalman Hotel -RRB- .
The naming of streets were also based on religions .
Several clubs related to the activities of trekking and rock climbing have into existence these 3 days .
These clubs take their members for trekking and rock climbing to mountains .
After achieving expertese in these activities members are taken to high mountain place for climbing .
Where they easily learn the methods of ice and snow crafts .
Enough knowledge can be gained about this game if one goes for trekking and rock climbing etc . with an experienced friend or trainer .
Initially one should go out to mountain places with anyone on any holiday .
Later the person himself becomes used to this game .
By reading the history of mountaineering one gets to know that most of the accidents take place due the mistake of the climbers themselves .
On several occasions climbers take wrong decisions .
They have to pay for these wrong decisions of mountaineers .
Therefore it is necessary that we should be able to choose right and wrong in time .
The biggest principle in mountaineering is to save oneself .
For this it is necessary to know that during mountaineering there is no place for emotions like defeat and victory .
This game of mountaineering brings the climber very near to the wholeness full of the beauty of nature .
Mountaineering keeps the player physically and mentally awake .
In this game the person recognizes his physical stength along with mental alertness .
Player gets face to face with the mountaines openly .
Other members of the team watch each of his activities .
The virtues that develop in the mountaineers during mountaineering are helpful in the formation of his character .
Today there is a lack of such people in in country who can provide leadership to the society .
This lack can be fulfilled with the virtues developed during mountaineering .
Like hockey , footbal and cricket etc . in mountaineering also special kind of shoes are necessary .
For mountaineering it is extremely mandatory for the shoes to be comfortable , reliable and convinient .
Mountaineers have to spend the most of his time on snow and glaciers .
Mountaineers should not show any kind of carelessness in the matter of shoes .
Double layered water proof shoes are needed in mountaineering .
While buying shoes for mountaineering it should be considered that they can protect feet from melting in extreme cold .
When one has to stay for long in the snow then to keep shoes dry an outer show is used over it .
Due to being water proof such shoes of nylon save the shoes from getting wet .
Due to these shoes the leather of the internal shoes does not get frozen at heights .
If such shoes are not availbale then using gaiter in place of that is good .
Aluminium foil is very useful for mountaineers to escape from cold .
According to their needs mountaineers use aluminium foil .
Aluminium foil is very thin like paper .
The shape of aluminium foil can be made very small by folding .
So small that mountaineer can even keep the aluminium foil in his pocket .
To escape from extreme cold some people also use the aluminium file as tent .
Some mountaineesr wrap the aluminium foil around their body and sleep in the sleeping bag .
Before wearing shoes and socks if aluminium foil is wrapped around the feet then it is very helpful in keeping the feet warm .
Feet are also very comfortable in aluminium foil .
For protecton from snowy fast winds wind shielder clothes are brought to use .
During mountaineering one should always keep wind shielder coat with him .
Just as one experiences the need one should wear the wind shielder coat immediately .
In wind shielder coat there is a big pocket towards the front and two pockets on the sides .
Besides food items i . . lunch packet , dry raisins , pairs of gloves and socks . spectacle protecting one from the glare of snow , diar , whistle and torch can easily be kept in the wind shielder coat .
A cap is attached with the wind shielder coat or jacket of this type .
Head , neck and ears can be covered with this .
Where there is too much of snow or there is slippage on the snow wind there shielder pants are used .
Wind shielder pants are also made of good variety of wind shielder cloth .
Therefore wind shielder pants are very light .
The amount of cold on high mountains can not be estimated while living in the fields .
To escape from this cold wind shielder and water proof clothes made of nylon are used .
Soft feathers of good quality are filled in the wind shielder clothes .
Wind shielder clothes are used in extreme cold at heights while mountaineering or at night when it gets very cold .
In such wind shielder jacket or coat there are caps and pockets .
Wind shielder clothes are used as per needs .
In mountaineering hands have to work comparatively more than any other parts of the body .
Therefore protecting hands in every way is very necessary .
If climbing is done in lower areas in the winter season even then woolen gloves are needed .
In snow and cold one can not even imagine to ascend without wind shielder clothes .
Climber has to use sun hat , beret i . . hat , cap , helmet , sun glasses and snow goggles etc . regularly .
As there are no trees and other greenery on high mountains the air there has less oxigen .
On high mountains the rays of sun fall directly on the body .
Open parts of body get very soon affected with the rays of the sun .
The spectacle used in the snow to protect from the glare and shine of the snow is a necessary equipment for the mountaineers .
With the shine of the snow the possibility of snow blindness is always there .
Taking ordinary bed for mountaineering can never be imagined .
For mountaineering campaign sleeping bag can be used .
Sleeping bag is like a bag .
Getting inside sleeping bag , climber can sleep comfortably .
The lining of sleeping bag is very light , warm and hot , being filled with soft feathers of nylon of birds .
After lying in the sleeping bag the mountaineer closes himself from inside with the help of a zip .
There is also a cap in the sleeping bag to cover the head .
The cold of mountains can be easily challenged while sleeping in the sleeping bag .
If you look at the history of mountaineering then you will find that there has been several ups and downs in it .
From the start itself several unwanted circumstances have face to face in mountaineering .
At times several accidents have also beein occurring in mountaineering .
It has been occurring mainly because of the lack of equipments of good quality and technical knowledge developed in the area of mountaineering .
Besides this difficulties occur also because of the ignorance and inexperience of climbers .
The history of mountaineering in India is not very old .
In the form of adventurous game this would be considered a totally new activity .
When in May 1953 Tenzing Norgay along with Edmund Hillary climbed the highest mountain peak Everest then the attention of Indians also got attracted towards this adventurous game .
There is no doubt in it that like other games risks are to be taken even during mountaineering .
May be compared to some other games mountaineering has little more risks .
Due to accidents , climbers have also lost their lives several times .
It does not mean that one should not do mountaineering .
There is no aspect of life which is untouched from accidents .
So , should one stop traveling or not do daily works ?
Doing this is not possible .
If it is so then why be afraid of mountaineering .
During mountaineering a person gets the opportunity to test his virtures like strength , self-confidence , courage and leadership etc .
Person does not only enjoy the pleasure of natural beauty . rather he himself lives in lap of the nature .
It has been seen often that on mountains most of the accidents take place due to the equipments of mountaineering .
Not making any plans for any campaign and not being cautious of the problems which are known become the cause of accident .
Due to more experience , credible equipments and planned method in mountaineering , the extent of safety in has increased very much in it .
A mountaineer faces a difficult situation with his intelligence and the capacity to organise .
Through this , along with physical development of the climber , his intellectual and mental development also take place .
Mountaineering obstacles can be divided into three categories .
Natural obstacles , personal obstacle and mental obstacles .
During mountaineering the most prominent and the most complex natural obstacle is that of avalanche .
There is a huge lump of unstable snow on mountains which starts sloping down due to any reason .
Avalanche is that big lump of snow which shakes from it place for any reason and starts slipping down on the slope of the mountain .
The slope which has its angle more than 25 degrees has a chance of avalanche .
While crossing such places or while climbing it one needs to be extremely careful .
In mountaineering avalanche is a serious problem which always stands before the climber as challenge .
Its consequences are very dangerous therefore they should be very alert and cautious towards this .
Due to this very carelessness and lack of alertness most of the accidents in the mountaines take place .
Avalanche is just another form of death therefore climbers should have full awareness about it .
They can get completely buried under the heap of stones , rocks and snow coming in avalanche .
Where the climber may die due to suffocation under the heap of snow .
Snow falls all around on the mountains .
There are some places where the snow gets a solid base .
Its layers get solidified one after another .
Snow falls at some slope or slant .
When its shape and load get very large then slope or slants become incapable of to provide support .
In the same way due to weather also the snow starts slipping from where it is standing because that has no base .
Avalanche can start any slope .
The more the slope the more the possiblity for the avalance to start .
If the slope is of dense vegetation , grass , trees , bushes and large rocks .
It gives good base to the snow .
Temperature , air and water on mountains play a very important role in making the state of the snow volatile .
Avalanche in mountains is a very common event .
Due to sharp slope landslides starts very easily in heavy rains .
Many times when the soil below gets displaced from its place the base of the upper area is lost and the climbers start falling .
Often all the climbers have to face such situation .
When one has to cross any such place then one needs to be very careful .
Often the tourists and mountaineers coming to the mountains for the first time do not give any importance of mountain rivers and moats .
Because they have seen big rivers in the plains .
These rivers have wide banks .
On the coming of floods these rivers cause havoc .
Therefore such climbers feel these rivers - streams flowing on the mountains to be very small .
At some places these river - streams can also be crossed by jumping .
Therefore climbers start crossing it very carelessly .
The reality is that if someone slips while crossing these river - streams then it gets difficult for them to stand up again .
Limbs start freezing due to cold water flowing with speed .
Dangerous blow can be caused due to fall on the stones .
While crossing , the members of the team should tie themselves in a rope .
The first member of the team should move ahead while groping such crevices with the help of his ice axe .
Whenever one has to cross such road one should keep the equipments related to crevace along .
If the crevace is narrow then members should cross while jumping one by one .
Every member must belay .
If doing so is not possible then the team should move slowly , with each member belaying .
When glaciers flow on more slopy slants then they break .
The part of this broken glacier is called ice fall .
In the part of broken glacier the ' pinnacles ' built like peaks are called ice tower .
This pinnacle is also called ' serac ' .
These pinnacles are very volatile .
Therefore one should walk avoiding these pinnacles as much as possible .
If doing so is not possible then one should take total precaution while crossing them because these pinnacles can break at any time .
On mountains and specially on the Himalayas the weather plays an important role in the success or failure of any mountaineering campaign .
Three campaigns by Indians for climbing the Everest in 1960 , 1962 and 1985 became unsuccessful just because of bad weather .
In the campaign of 1985 India had to lose five experienced mountaineers forever .
Rains , snow or hailstorm , haze or fog , snowy storm , darkness , cold , heat , storm or lightening etc . all are different parts of weather .
In mountains weather changes suddenly .
In three four days temperature changes dramatically .
In mountains one can get so see any color of weather .
One should use good good raincoat in case of rains or snow on the mountains .
You should take off wet clothes and wear dry clothes immediately after reaching the camp .
If it starts hailing or snow storms comes or high wind starts blowing or the fog or haze gets very dense then you should stop at a safe place and wait for the weather to get clear .
Commonly on mountains the weather gets bad after noon .
You should try to do all your important work in the morning .
On getting stuck in snow storm you should try to take shelter amidst rocks , caves or in hollows of trees .
To face cold weather it is appropriate to come out for mountaineering only with woollen clothes of good variety and sleeping bag .
To escape from lightening you should keep all the metallic items like ice axe , piton , crampons and utensils etc . away from yourself .
Putting the rucksack down you should sit upon it yourself in such a way so that feet keep touching the ground .
Place hands on the ears and keep your eyes closed when there is lightening .
Try to hold breath when there is lightening .
If there has been lightening somewhere around then do not start your activities at least for thirty minutes .
If there are many members in the group then move at a distance at least twenty feet away from each other .
If someone gets hurt by lightening treat him immediately .
Treat the burnt spots in the same manner as it is usually done when some part gets burnt .
The third phase of mountaineering is snow climbing .
First of all an individual is introduced to the mountains through trekking .
He prepares himself to climb on high mountains through rock climbing .
The actual mountaineering starts when a person puts his first step on snow .
The climbers have to face new types of difficulties in snow climbing .
Which he did not have to come across while doing rock climbing .
So the person should be well aware of the basic fundamentals of snow climbing before going for mountaineering .
If we talk of information on the situation of snow only for roaming in snow then the case will appear very complicated .
Only superficial things can be talked about this topic .
There is no reason talking on the subject of the relation between the condition of snow on the mountains and climbing .
The best way to learn about it is learning through one 's own experience .
Some practical knowledge about snow climbing definitely would be helpful to the person during snow climbing .
By taking care of these things the climber is able to climb quickly and easily .
The condition of snow on high mountains undergoes change very rapidly .
This change is caused due to altitude , temperature , wind , sun and the types of mountains .
The higher the height of the mountains the more the snow there .
The temperature of day and night becomes the cause for many changes .
The change occurs due to wind too .
The snow starts melting or becomes soft during daytime due to the heat of sun .
The snow becomes hard at night as it gets frozen .
Layers of snow start forming on this hard snow .
This way hard layers are formed there at the top and soft layers at the bottom .
It is called hard snow in technical language .
A climber finds various kinds of snows like fresh snow , soft snow , hard snow , crusted or layered snow , powdery snow , wet snow and thawing snow etc . during mountaineering .
When there is new snowfall , it is clean and dry .
The climber may sink deep down in this type of new snow .
This new snow does not have any attachment with any object under it .
The particles of new snow are not yet stuck with each other .
Walking in this new snow is a very tiring job .
After falling on the rocks and glaciers this new snow rapidly slides down .
One should not cross a steep slope when there has been fresh snow fall .
You should cross that slope only after at least two - three days .
This type of snow keeps on falling usually on the Himalayas .
The climbers who do not care about this become the victims of an accident .
If it is inevitable to cross such a place then it is essential to pay attention to a few things .
For the sake of caution one should clear the path of such snow by throwing stones or snow balls etc .
On doing so the upper layer of the snow gets displaced down .
Powdery snow is like fresh snow but its color is slightly greyish or brown .
Powdery snow looks dirty in appearance .
There is very less amount of water in the powdery snow due to transformation of moisture into vapor .
The temperature on the mountains in day time is high due to the direct sun rays and mild air .
The snow melts and becomes wet due to this .
One can put feet firmly and walk on the wet snow but boots and clothes become wet due to this .
The color of wet snow is blue .
This situation occurs on the mountains usually during daytime .
Because water keeps on flowing above and also under the wet snow .
Thawing snow or melting snow is more wet than even wet snow .
The reason for this too is that the temperature rises during the day and reaches at freezing point during the night .
If the process of melting snow goes on continuously for several days then the surface breaks down from somewhere and holes are formed at some places .
It becomes difficult to cross such place too .
Especially during morning time when it is very slippery here .
It is better to use crampons at the places of melting snow .
Dry snow is the one when water is not visible and the snow does not stick to the hands either .
Wet snow sticks to hands when pressed and water appears in it .
Water starts flowing from the slush snow even without pressing it .
When the fist thrusts inside the snow it is soft snow .
Snow with medium hardness is the one when forefinger easily goes into it .
Hard snow is the one in which a pencil would insert more easily than finger .
When only the blade of knife can enter in it then it is considered extremely hard snow .
One more thing that a climber should keep in mind and should have complete knowledge about , is the angle of the slope .
Before adopting any method of climbing the information about the angle of slope is as impoortant as to know what is the type of snow and how hard it is .
Calculating the angle of slope is also necessary because it has direct correlation with sliding of snow which starts the avalanche .
Innumerable climbers of mountaineering have to pass through many types of structures of snow .
For example snow bridge , carnis , snow ridge and avalanche etc .
It is very important for a climber to have information about all these too because his mission can succeed only after climbing successfully on them .
These structures have often become the reason of many fatal accidents .
There is a lot of snowfall on high mountains during winter time as the result of which rivers , drains , cracks and lanes etc . get covered with snow .
The snow starts melting and the frozen water starts flowing in summers due to sun and high temperature .
A large amount of snow hanging at the edge of mountains is called carnis .
Carnis snow brings along wind with itself which goes on depositing at the edge of the mountain .
Carnis usually collects at the place where ridge is a steep slope from one side and its other slope is normal .
The snow goes on depositing on this with the wind towards the steep slope and when it becomes too much it forms like a peak and starts hanging baseless .
The ridge of snow is that line where two sides of mountain meet .
In other words the long narrow peak of mountain is called the ridge of snow .
The shape of ridge is very sharp on high mountains .
The slopes on the both sides of snow ridge can be up to 600 to 900 metres .
It is not an easy job to climb on the snow ridge .
The members should be completely billayed while walking on the snow ridge .
Every climber should walk on either side of the slope where he can maintain a good balance .
If at all one has to walk on the ridge due to some reason then he should walk from the side facing the slope .
Every member should bury the ice axe deep inside the snow and billay .
The climber uses many kinds of techniques as per his convenience and situation for snow climbing .
To cross any slope during snow climbing the climber or the climbing group has to create steps to move forward .
It becomes very convenient to walk when such steps are made in fresh , dry , wet and soft snow .
These steps are made in accordance with the nature of the slope .
Type of snow , goal of making steps and number of members in the group too have to be taken into account for this .
These steps are made in single , dual or diagonal ways .
When the snow is a bit harder and it is not possible to make steps by pressing with foot then they are made with the kick of the boot .
These steps made with the boot 's kick too may be single , dual or diagonal .
Apart from the tip of the boot its both sides are also used when diagonal steps have to be made .
There is extra pressure on the toes in this .
So one should take care that the toes do not get injured in any condition .
This is a very hard job .
Ice axe should also be used when required .
It becomes necessary to cut out stairs in the snow where the snow is extremely hard and it is not possible to make steps with kick and climbing can not be done wearing crampons either .
The job of cutting out stairs in snow is usually done by ice axe .
When it is not possible to cut out stairs in extremely hard snow then the work of cutting them is done with spade or the wider side of ice axe .
Ice axe is used from the side so that the climber does not injure himself .
The stair is cut with the pointed side of ice axe and the snow is cleaned with the wider side .
The last part of the stair should be tilted towards inside .
Snow climbing is not only difficult but also dangerous .
Because it is too difficult to find strong anchors in the snow and billaying is also a difficult task .
It is not possible to climb safely in the absence of strong anchor and not being able to billay .
The fear that some accident might happen is always there in the mind of a climber in such situations .
It is almost impossible to avoid any accident without a safe anchor and billay .
Billay can be done very well in the rocks and ice as strong anchor is found there .
Billay is not possible in fresh snow due to various reasons .
Yet there has been considerable reduction in accidents caused by slipping due to deadman , deadboy , snow stakes and snow flukes .
Very steep slopes are climbed by traversing or crossing the slope from one end towards the other end .
In this situation , the climber can use the ice axe depending on his need and the situation of slope as per any of the three ways mentioned below .
On normal slopes the climber may hold the ice axe in hands keeping it above himself towards the slope .
In a situation of falling down the climber may pierce the tip of the ice axe and hang along with it .
If the ice axe is in the lower hand the climber will have to bend down to fix it in the slope .
There will be possibility of losing his balance due to this .
A climber can not imagine doing snow  ice climbing without ice axe even for a minute as it is the third leg .
Not only during ascending or descending . climber needs an ice axe each and every moment .
He can not control himself from sliding or falling without an ice axe .
Therefore a serious accident can happen in the absence of an ice axe .
Climbers have been successful in saving themselves from accidents on the mountains many times due to ice axe .
If the team leader reaches on a flat surface and no convenient location for anchoring is visible to him then there also deadman comes in use .
Dig out 20 - 25 cm deep depending on the situation of the snow there .
Now make a vertical cut in it at the side where the place for putting rope is made .
Hammer the deadman at the bottom of the pit making correct angle .
The access and use of deadboy are both same as deadman .
Snow fluke was not used as much before .
It was found through experience that snow flukes were better than deadmen .
Snow fluke adjusts itself in the right condition with the pull of a load even if it is being used in soft snow .
Many climbers prefer the use of snow stakes to ice axe .
They think that the handle of ice axe can break .
There is no fear of breaking snow stakes as it is made up of strong alloys .
Snow stakes are of different types , small and big .
Snow stakes can be used as per the condition of snow .
Snow stakes is used both for anchoring and billaying .
The slope of hard snow can be climbed by wearing crampons .
In the absence of crampons the climber has to do the hard work of cutting stairs there .
Usually the slope with 40 degrees can be climbed by wearing crampons .
Experienced climbers can climb on the sharp slope too , wearing them .
The climber does not have full knowledge about the kinds of places he would have to pass through on his way while mountaineering .
So whether or not crampons will be used one has to go for climbing keeping them alongwith .
Some climbers consider the crampons a necessary evil .
Some climbers consider crampons as deceiving equipment but the fact is that mountaineering is not possible without it .
Tying crampon properly is an art in itself .
It requires a lot of practice to tie crampons before going for mountaineering .
A lot of practice is required to walk wearing crampons .
The climber has to get used to walking wearing crampons .
He feels uncomfortable to walk with crampons .
Only those mountaineers should climb on the mountains with crampons who are confident of themselves .
It is not very diffucult job to descend in snow .
Unless they are very high places , as the slopes of these places are extremely difficult and the risk of falling down is also very high .
Even while descending the last member has to face the most problem .
So the last member descending should be either the leader of the group or a veteran mountaineer who can take care of himself .
This is necessary because he has to climb down without billay .
There is no risk in descending in soft snow .
There is no risk of getting any type of serious injury even if somebody falls .
Nevertheless the mountaineers should not take any kind of risk while descending .
One should descend carefully in proper way .
When the climber comes down sitting and slipping in the snow on his own will .
Slipping in the snow to come down is called glissading .
If the slope covered with snow is not very difficult and dangerous then the method of glissading is least time taking and enjoyable .
In glissading you should ensure that the last part of the slope is visible to you or you know that you can easily stop there .
Glissading can be done standing too .
Glissading while sitting is also called optional glissading .
In this the climber slides down looking towards bottom while sitting on his buttocks with his legs up .
If the slope and snow are good then the climber descends down like a wood floating in river .
Local people also use glissading method to come down .
It is very painful to come down when there is too much snowfall .
When there is too much snow the ice axe should be kept near chest in braking position so that it is easy to stop when required .
The correct position and direction of sliding can be determined by pressing the tip of ice axe towards backside and down .
If the slope is too difficult and it is not possible to descend by glissading or doing hill work then the group has to come down billaying .
For billaying one should descend down extremely carefully while billaying with ice axe , deadman , snow stakes or snow flukes .
It is necessary that the member coming at the last is the most experienced climber because he will have to come down without billay .
Rappelling is a less time taking safe method .
But for rappelling it is necessary for the climber to be extremely experienced .
Rappelling on snow has to be done in the same way as it is done in rock climbing .
But the difference is that there is no strong anchor available on snow and the climber has to take support of artificial anchor only .
These anchors can be aluminum poles , snow stakes and sometimes ice axe .
Avoid glissading with rope .
Never do glissading without an ice axe .
If there is no ice axe it is not possible to hold oneself , if falling .
Never take the risk of glissading if you can not see the complete slope .
Glissading inside a lane can be dangerous as it ends abruptly .
Apart from this avalanche may start too with this kind of action .
It is never adivsable to do glissading wearing crampons .
Glissading should never be done on hard snow or ice in the morning time .
Glassiding should not be done on fresh snowfall .
Because some big stone . rock or ice may have been buried under it .
Glissading on fresh snow may lead to accident .
Glissading should not be done if the snow is in the state of avalanche .
It has been observed through experience that most of the accidents take place when the members of group are returning after completing the ascend .
Doing negligence of not using rope .
It becomes impossible to hold a falling climber as he is not tied with rope .
The excitement of climbing a peak is also mixed with negligence on such occasions .
The members forget that descending is no less important task than ascending .
Most of the team members are dead tired while descending .
The climbers fail to make balance on some difficult slopes .
Many accidents have taken place due to the lumps forming under crampons .
Climbers meet with accidents also by entangling with crampons .
The climber has to cross areas filled with many kinds of ice here .
Such as Blue Ice , Black Ice , Snow Ice , Water Ice , White Ice , Verglasss Ice and Glacier Ice etc .
As far as relation with mountaineering is concerned . climber is only concerned with those three methods using which he has to ascend on the peak crossing those different kinds of ice zones .
Glacier is called the river of ice .
A glacier can be a few hundred meters to several kilometres long .
Glacier flows with a very slow speed .
The speed of glacier can be from a few centimetres to a few metres in a year .
A glacier is called a river because of its flow only .
There are waves , waterfalls and flat surfaces in a glacier like a river .
There are ice falls too in a glacier .
The surface of ice fall breaks to create huge lumps and mountain like structures of snow .
Crevace is formed due to bending of ice fall in any direction and presence of uneven surface under it .
Climbers have to cross several types of glaciers during mountaineering expedition .
When there are no snow , stone , gravel lying on the glacier and its crevace is clearly visible then it is called dry glacier .
When the glacier is filled with fresh and wet snow , water is flowing on some parts of it and its crevace is covered with snow then it is called wet glacier .
Doing any activity or walking on the glacier is a too complicated , difficult and dangerous job in itself .
The reason for it is its height , extreme cold out there , its high and low surfaces .
Crossing the stones and rocks lying on the glacier , crossing its hidden bridges and covered crevaces is difficult .
The climber must be very experienced to cross a glacier .
It is safe to cross the glacier on which snow is lying in the early morning in summer season .
The bridges of snow that form on the glacier are also strong .
As the bridges formed on snow become weak as the day progresses , they start becoming unreliable .
Adequate experience is required to decide which way to climb the glacier .
One should choose such a path on which least natural obstacles are expected .
In other words there is least possibility of falling stones and rocks or having avalanche .
The snow lying on crevace is white whereas the snow lying on other parts of glacier is not that white .
There is big difference in the whiteness of snow lying both in crevace and glacier .
The snow lying on the walls of crevace is not that flat .
The part in between the walls of crevace is slightly pressed .
If the crevace is little wider the party can cross it by using the aluminium ladder brought along with itself .
This aluminium ladder is of the type which can be kept folded .
The aluminium ladder should be fixed properly on the both sides .
Then all the members can go across on the aluminium ladder one by one .
Everyone should be properly billayed .
If mountaineers climb on the glacier with utmost care there is no reason why any member would fall in the crevace .
Nevertheless , just in case some accident takes place , one should go out on climbing prepared for it .
Usually all the methods of snow climbing are used in ice climbing too .
Only the condition of ice is different in ice climbing .
It may be hard ice in morning and evening .
It may be mixed or wet type of ice between morning and evening time .
If the methods of snow climbing are not coming in use due to hard ice or because it is on glacier then one has to take help of special type of technique .
These methods are generally the same which are brought into use while doing rock climbing .
If the climber is not able to make space on ice with the kick of boot , crampons do not hold the ice and the slope over there is sharp then he has to cut stairs or steps there .
If the climber is having difficulty in maintaining his balance then he has to make hold for hand with the help of ice axe .
If such holds do not seem reliable then he has to climb by hammering pitton and screw in the same way as in artificial rock climbing .
When an avalanche takes place then it is bound to have difficulties while doing ice climbing above and below the carnis , in the crevace and on the places with hard ice .
Similarly the layer frozen with particles of water and wet ice are also dangerous .
If the climber does not climb with full precaution and commits a small mistake or carelessness then accident takes place .
Like glass this layer forms on rocks and stones at the time when the rain water freezed on them due to cold .
Snow melts in the heat of day and freezes at night .
When mountaineers go for a mountaineering campaign then they continuously have to face several problems and difficulties there .
While some problems in mountaineering are physical some are psychological .
One also has to face several types of diseases and accidents .
In mountaineering one also has to adopt safety means .
Several mountaineering campaigns have failed just because their plan was formulated well from the start .
So much of money and time has wasted as a result of mountaineering without plan .
Several times priceless life has also been lost .
In any campaign several types of challenges have to faced .
In any campaign several types of known - unknown problems emerge .
In any campaign of mountaineering food has a very important place .
The biggest thing is that finding one 's favorite food is not possible here .
Totally different environment , if the climber does not find his favorite food after the tiredness exerted through continuous work then he feels even worse .
Along with this on mountains one needs very balanced and nutritious food .
A mountaineer during ascent needs 4200 calories .
Mountaineer needs 3200 calories at a height of 6070 metres and 1500 calories above the height of 7300 metres .
Considering these amounts three types of menus are required .
Food items should be bought according to this .
Calculating on a daily basis a menu should be prepared and kept along .
These days it is getting difficult to find coolies and sherpas to go the mountains .
Even those who agree to go to the mountains they demand much more money .
Thus for small campaign teams reaching mountains is getting difficult .
We have already given information about several general problems .
It has also been said how to escape that or how not to let them happen .
Here something is being said about some such problems which are related to treatment .
When climber goes to high mountains for the first time for climbing then he feels the environment there totally different .
The first four days of mountaineering for the mountaineer are specially difficult .
The pressure of oxygen on mountains are less .
Any problem occuring because of the paucity of oxygen can occur in mountains .
Especially to youths and those who have to work more on mountains , these problems disturb more .
The symptoms of this disease start showing up within four to ninety hours of reaching the high mountains .
Mountaieers starts having complaints of headache , dizziness , vomiting , concentration disturbance , anorexia , cough , loose motion , chest pain , breathlessness , weakness and swelling in feet and legs etc .
Its root cause is the non-adaptability of the body to the environment of the mountains .
Because of this several other types of problems start occurring .
Their end comes in the form of acute mountain sickness .
When climbers reach high place then blood in the body redistributes .
Its best treatment is not to go up very fast .
On being afflicted with the mountain sickness disease one should take total rest .
In mountain sickness one gets more oxygen with long and deep breath .
On taking aspirin or morphine headaches get lessened but you must take medicine with the help of doctor only .
This is the most horrible form of this disease in which water gets filled in the lungs of the patient .
Patient climber can not take oxygen inside .
With this the blood carrying veins get affected and climber falls ill .
The main reason for water getting filled in the lungs is a different kind of environment .
Rescue work in mountains is a vast subject in itself .
We will focus briefly on only a few topics here .
Whenever any small or big accident takes place on mountains then there is a need of rescue work there .
The members of the mountaineering team have to do the rescue work themselves .
But if the situation is not under their control then one might need to get help from someone .
In such a situation they contact one such organization which does the rescue work .
Generally large campaign teams have wireless .
Through this they keep in touch with each other .
When the members of the teams that do not have wireless facility go up for climbing from the base camp then they are fully taken care of from below .

Reaching an age of 64 years , Chandraprabha Aitwal has encouraged not only the new mountaineers by climbing the Shrikanth Peak , she also has plans to do more climbs along with other young mountaineers .
One among the prominent women mountaineers of the country , the sixty eight year old Chandraprabha Aitwal , has conquered the 20,116 feet high Shreekanth Peak as the leader of a group of girls .
After successful campaign at this age a desire to climb the Everest has again emerged in Chandraprabha Aitwal 's mind .
This campaign completed with the girls considered novices in such campaign is unique in itself .
Prior to this in the year of 1997 also Chandraprabha Aitwal had successfully climbed the Shreekanth Peak as a leader .
In year 1999 the bones of her legs got broken in the accident that occurred in Bhanvali while coming back from the journey of Kailash Manasarovar and she was not being able to psychologically prepare herself for mountaineering .
Then when she got the opportunity to do the difficult trek from Malari to Milam with the contemporary minister Mohan Singh Gaonwasi , confidence of this experienced women mountaineer came back .
Chandraprabha Aitwal says that when she expressed her desire to go for Shreekanth Campaign along with a team of girls to the Indian Mountaineering Foundation -LRB- I . . . -RRB- then considering her experience I . . . gladly permitted her for this campaign .
To go with Aitwal in this campaign , the I . . . chose Brunda of Tamilnadu , Amaraina of Laddakh , Dolley and Rima of Shillong , Bali and Dr . Surabhi of Gujarat , Rajal of Punjab , Mamta of Haryana and Chanda and Rekha of Uttarakhand .
Full of courage and energy Chandraprabha Aitwal moved from Uttarkashi with these ten young women .
She says , Loooking like thumb the peak of the Shrikanth mountain is extremely beautiful .
Its beautiful view is seen from several places of Uttarkashi district including Warsu , Raithal , Dayaar , Bugyaal .
The goal of this campaign was also to study the geographical and eco-systemic changes , status of glaciers and snows occurring in its way after the year of 1997 .
Chandraprabha Aitwal says that in Jangla one has to climb a straight ascent of 14 kilometres amidst dense forests .
There are also forests of cedar and chenar on the way .
Despite Uttarakhand having enough poplar the polar here did not get either that importance nor the fame .
She says the local residents also consider the poplar as a variety of local tree ' pangar ' .
This campaign team made its base camp at a height of 12,900 feet on the banks of Dudugad -LRB- small river -RRB- .
Small mountain rivers flowing amidst beautiful Himalayan wild flowers in the month of August were the center of attraction for the girls coming from different parts of the country .
J . Ramanan the photographer going with the team photographed the plants , insects , flowers and wild animals in these areas .
After the base camp the advance base camp -LRB- ABC -RRB- was built at a height of a little more than 1500 feet .
After the year of 1997 much of the soil had flown away and landslides had also occurred in this area .
Then ABC used to have enough water but in the meanwhile due to climate change enough natural water was not available here even for cooking food .
After the base camp mountaineers go to each camps and come back three - four times to stay for the night .
Along with the adaptation of the body with the height and environment this also facilitates the transport of necessary goods to the camps ahead .
Aitwal says that from 14 to 17 August the weather was bad therefore on 15 August the independence day was celebrated in ABC itself with the hoisting of flag .
Beautiful Himalayan plants like Brahmakamal , Phenakamal are found only upto ABC .
There is no vegetation above this , only rocks , maurine and snow .
Climbing is done through ropes only after camp one located at the height of 17,000 feet .
A four kilometre long rope is attached through camp one till the peak .
In between , Camp Two -LRB- Summit Camp -RRB- was built at a height of 18,000 feet .
After bad weather and snow fall including Aitwal eight girls and three assistants climbed the Shreekanth Peak successfully on 24 August .
Starting her career in the year of 1965 as a teacher in Pithoragarh , Chandraprabha Aitwal had done the basic course of mountaineering in the year of 1972 from Nehru Institute of Mountaineering -LRB- NIM -RRB- .
Then she had come to Garhwal from Kumaun for the first time .
In the year of 1975 after being a member of the successful campaign team of 22,410 feet high peak Kedardom , she never looked back .
She was one among the three Indian women mountaineers climbing the 25,447 feet high peak ' Comet ' in the year of 1977 .
She had also successfully climbed Nanda Devi -LRB- 26,654 feet -RRB- the highest peak of India along with Harshavanti Bisht and Rekha Sharma in the campaign of year 1981 .
After the success of this campaign in 1994 she received the Arjuna award .
Since then till today no women mountaineer has been able to climb the Nanda Devi peak believed to be technically extremely difficult .
Despite participating in the Everest campaigns she regrets the compulsion to stay a little away from the peak after the Summit Camp at the last moment .
Aitwal says that the challenges of Everest the highest peak of the world are different but several peaks of India are even more dangerous and challenging than the Everest .
New mountaineers should miss the opportunity to climb these peaks .

This has been built specially for the conservation of desert animals .
Pokharan has become famous due to atomic explosions .
Forts and Havelis here are worth watching .
This place is located at a distance of 110 kilmetres from Jaisalmer .
Apart from traditional hill stations in the country there are several such places which are enough to impress upon anyone with its eyecatching views .
One among these is also the Arku Valley located in the coastal hills of Andhra Pradesh .
The truth is that the people do not know as much the valley called Niligiri than the famous Nilgiri of Tamilnadu .
Just as you reach Arku from the hot and humid environment , its natural view and cool wind hypnotise .
The name of Arku valley having an expanse of 30 kilometres is based on the Arku settlement which is a anonymous hill settlement .
Surrounded by hills and located at the heights in between 800 to 900 metres , wherever the sight goes in Arku Valley , it is all greenery .
There are three main ways to reach Arku , the way most full of natural views goes through Vishakhapattanam .
If you want to make your journey from Visakhapattanam to Arku , then choose the railways only and do the return journey through roadways .
On this railway passing through densely populated area there is only rail service available which runs from 6 . 50 o'clock in the morning and completes the journey of 132 kilometres up to Arku by 11 o'clock .
After this it goes to Kirandul of Dantewada -LRB- Bastar -RRB- .
This train gets in Arku once again in return .
Although the time of this train starting is quarter to 7 o'clock , but does passenger train get easy pass ?
Therefore everyday it gets late in running .
But who knows , it starts right time the day when you are going and you miss it .
Anyway , from here you can go to Arku through roadways also .
Buses and taxis are available .
If you want to see the views of hills of the valley then taking a window seat towards the left side of the bogey would be appropriate .
However it is fully a passenger train , but some bogeys are reserved for the packages of tourism department .
Passing through the farms when the train moves ahead amidst the bushes of coconut and palm then one does not feel the journey ahead .
Before the start of the hilly journey the major stops are Shivalingapuram and Kottavalsa , moving a little ahead of which the hill journey begins .
330 kms long rail line in between Vishakhapattanam and Kirandoolwas built in 1966-67 in association with the government of Japan which brings the iron ore from Beladila mines of Bastar to Vishakhapattanam .
From where it gets exported to Japan by ships .
Therefore throughout the way you will get to see goods train empty and laden with iron stones .
Wherever you pass your sight on both the sides of the railway , only greenery shows up .
When the snaky road starts once after kottavalsa , it does not end until Arku .
One has to pass through tunnels also on this way .
There are 47 more tunnels on this way till now some of which are also big tunnels that are longer than even 500 metres .
After getting out of each of tunnel you get a different air and different view .
The coldness of the air and landscape of the delta calm the body and heart .
Excitement keeps on throughout the journey about how will it will be ahead .
It is half past ten o'clock and the train has so far completed the journey of 75 kms .
Now its speed is slowing .
On peeping is seen a board , Tyada , height from the sea level 760 metres .
When we started we were at the sea level .
In the cold wind of Tyada everybody naturally forgets the humidity filled heat of Vishakhapattanam .
The facilities of trekking , camping is there for tourists in Tyada .
If there is time there is a huge Borarguhal i . . Borra Cave here .
This 10 lac years old huge cave and the white stones built in it can surprise anyone .
The arrival of tourists started in this old cave when this rail line was expanded .
Geologist William King found about this cave in 1807 and studied it .
The largeness of the cave is discovered only after entering inside it .
Inside you get to see several types of constructions built of calcium rocks .
Now it is upon you what you see in them .
The arrangement of cave is in the hands of tourism department of Andhra Pradesh .
If you are new then it would be apt to take guide .
Proper arrangement for entrance and exit is there inside it so that tourists do not face inconvinience .
With the oncoming of railway line tourists have also started coming here .
Most of people planning to tour Araku in one day get down at ` Borra Cave ' .
Completing the tour here they go through the roadways to see the views of Araku , which is 30 kms away from here .
If your ticket is upto Araku , then wait , because ahead is - Simliguda , which is the highest point of this journey .
A total of 996 metres above the sea level .
The highest railway station of broad gauge line in India .
However after the start of the under-construction railway line of Kashmir its challenge will end .
From Simliguda the views of Araku valley become visible from where the rail line starts lowering .
Seeing outside you find the currents of rail Gosthani sometimes nearby while sometimes afar .
Afterall , once again the train stops with bumping .
Upon asking we find that it is Araku station halt .
But nothing like platform is seen here .
You can get down here as well as at Araku station which is at a distance of 3 kms .
The benefit of getting down at Bazar Halt is that you can plan here starting from lodging to tours .
Like every other place even here taximen and autorickshaw drivers surround you .
Along with the package of providing hotel to the tour packages .
If you are expert at bargaining , then you can save some money .
If you know where you have to stay , then there is no problem .
You can find good and low budget hotels in the road from Araku colony to Railway Station .
You can see tribal dance here .
Araku is no big city .
It is a valley , where the views of nature can be seen .
Araku valley is a tribal area , where more than 14 tribes live .
There is a museum established by Tribal Development Authority here so that people know about the tribes .
A glimpse of the living , culture and traditions of the tribes residing in this region can seen in this museum .
Views of the rural life have been exhibited in the form of their models in it .
Its round construction is worth watching .
The architect of the museum can be praised for the way things have been presented here .
You can also get an experience of running the bows and arrows used by the tribal people here .
Facility of boating is also there in the complex .
Four kms away from Araku Bazaar and Araku Station spread in an area of 20 hectares , the Padampur Garden is such a garden which was built by the British Army for the supply of vegetables .
Later it was converted to botanical garden .
The Rishimukh built at the entrance causes curiosity .
Several varieties of flowers , trees , spices and herbs are grown in the gardens .
For the education tours for the students of botany and gardening this is an ideal place .
You can also travel through the toy train inside the garden .
You can also buy handicrafts built of wax and wood by the tribal women .
There are also a few huts for the stay of tourists in the garden .
By touring the tribal villages there in the Araku valley you can see and know their living closely .
The weekly market holding here is enough to cause curiosity in the new person .
You can spend two to three hours here .
The tourism of Araku is at its peak from November to February .
If you come in November , you must keep warm clothes .
It is rare that you wo n't get a chance to see the shooting of a film .
There are many gardens in these hills .
Besides the Duduma waterfall of Machkund nearby Araku valley two more big waterfalls are worth watching .
Sangda waterfall can also be toured .
As a souvenir of Araku you can buy crafts built of bamboo , wax and terracota and wood from the tribal handicraft shops built here .
One can see how are the coffe gardens and how cardamom is grown by visiting the villages here .
One travels to Darjeeling , Shimla or Ooty even today through narrow gauge , but the journey to the hills of Araku is of broad gauge .
Despite the speed of 20 kms the journey of this train also creates thrill .
Vishakhapattanam is connected through air service with Delhi , Hyderabad and Chennai .
In the same way direct rail service is available for Vizag from the major cities of the country .
All the major trains going North India to Karnataka , Tamilnadu , Kerala pass throug Vijaywada , from where Visakhapattanam is at a distance of 1 to 8 hours .
However one can come here by the north through Jagdalpur - Koraput but this way is not so popular .
One can reach here also through rail or roadways through Koraput .
Tourists coming to Bastar can come from Jagdalpur through Koraput .
The roadways from Bhuvaneshwar to Koraput is also an option .
This is extremely long , but the beauty of the coastal region is known by coming through this way only .
This road comes through the most Naxal-hit region of Orissa .
It takes 12 to 15 hours in the journey upto Koraput , but only a few people gather the courage to come with it .
If you have come to Araku with an intention to picnic , then it will be better that you see the important places here in a day , otherwise you can see the views nearby it while staying here comfortably .
Bikaner is one among the five major divisions of Rajasthan and this has been an important division and district headquarter of western Rajasthan since the time of the royalties .
Even today the people there remember Maharaja Gangasingh with great respect .
He was the king , who made Bikaner a garden in the second half of the twentieth century .
At that time the treatment and medical equipments that were available , they were no where in north-western India .
Prince Vijay Singh was the eldest and favorite son of Maharaja Gangasingh .
Before time , in the short age of youth he died due to some reason .
People used to come to this place from far-off places for treatment in Prince Vijay Singh Memorial -LRB- P . . . -RRB- built in his memorial .
The renowned doctors of Rajasthan also studied there and gave their services also there such as - Late Dr . . . Katju , Late Dr . . . Kansal , Late Dr . Sharda Rao respectively of orthopaedics , ophthalomolgy and gynaecology .
These main doctors were renowned at that time .
Till now this city has not been connected with air services regularly .
Air service is sometimes started and sometimes stopped .
However with the point of view of tourism there is so much to see here , but tourists want fast reaching direct service , which is not available .
Government wants to start fast train but ignoring the far-sightedness of the government even a petty local leader holding a flag along with five-ten villagers start demanding for stopping train at every station .
While the tourists want to reach Bikaner in the least time sitting directly from Delhi , Agra or Jaipur .
Now some steps have been taken for the beautification of Bikaner .
Leaving the roads of the boundry wall here -LRB- which now can not be widened -RRB- all the other remaining raods have been made four-lane .
Built in front of the famous Junagarh fort is the historical ' Sursagar ' which used to be a pleasant place in the decades of fourties , fifties , sixties .
In the cold wind of evening sitting on the squares of the stones built beside the water the elders used to talk , play chess , sing rammats - later that became shallow and stinky place of dirty water .
People passing through that area were compelled to cover their nose with cloth .
Since last thirty years there was no one to take care of this historical well .
Now its marshes have been cleaned .
Applying three borings in it clear , clean beautiful water has been filled .
Beautifying the famous public park it has been made like flowers of spring .
All around Junagarh fort proper road arrangement and proper lighting arrangement have been made , so that the fort looks beautiful even at night .
It has been more than 520 years since the settlement of Bikaner .
However by the administration its establishment day is celebrated on Akhateej -LRB- Akshay Tritiya Samvat 1545 i . . April , 1488 AD - according to Hindu calendar , because date changes every year -RRB- .
Bikaner is of great importance with the point of view of historical and tourism .
Among the big feudal areas of Rajasthan here the names of Bikaner , Udaipur , Jodhpur and Rawatsar are known because of mutual relationship .
However , the the royal family of Deogarh also comes in the same sequence .
No other areas got so much of historical aspect as these areas .
Its administration was more peaceful before the coming of the Mughals and the British .
During peace time only architecture and art rises .
Among the historical palaces Lalgarh Palace , the Fort of Junagarh , Museum , Ganga Theatre , Shri Kollayatdham , Gajner Palace and sanctuary , Husain Sar , National Ushtra , Research Centre , the temple of Karani Mother of Deshnok world renowned , the havelis of Ram Purias , the evening of Sursagar are worth watching .
In the past few years hotel business has emerged in Bikaner .
If you leave heritage hotels , which are a total of two or three , the remaining hotels of international level , local resorts , three star hotels are opening up in big numbers .
But everyone has to say the same thing that it will be difficult for us to work with thirty percent occupancy and there are also some problems .
One is that electricity goes off very often and the level of water of Bikaner has also gone very low .
Therefore the problem of water remains here .
For the foreign tourists it is necessary for the transport medium to be fast and convinient to reach here .
They have a lot of money , but less time .
Also there is no particular resource for local sightseeing .
There is a dearth of English speaking people .
Local guides do not know English properly and even if they speak mistakenly the pronunciation is never correct .
Given an opportunity or while talking with one another the foreigners laugh .
The public Hotel Tourist Bungalow is Dhola Maru which is in bad situation .
There are many dharamshalas but they do not get the inspiration to stay in the dharamshalas .
There are several places for touring in Bikaner and nearby , but they do not have appropriate publicity .
If you consider all the points above then with the point of tourism Bikaner can be given international status .
Working as assistant director in in the Tourism Department and Cultural Department , Bikaner of Rajasthan Tourism art and cultural Hanuman Mall says - Before coming to tourism I gave my services in the Air Force as well .
I am an officer who works in a planned way .
The responsibility of the organization of Camel Festival being held here is on me .
First time Camel Festival by our department was organised in Bikaner was held for two days on 22-23 January , 1994 .
It was new arrangements , some laggards were there , still they it was very succesfull .
Programmes were so much crammed that foreigners never got time off .
This is fifth biggest tourist destination of Rajasthan .
We are also planning for desert safari .
Next year there is a possibility of 75,000 foreigner and 2,10,000 national tourists coming here .
On the organization of the Camel Festival for the first time it got so much of fame and next year there was no space in the hotels including Dhola Maru .
Then several hotels were built in Bikaner .
Today the situation is that this year sixteenth fair was held this year .
People are still praising its success .
This is a matter of pride for us .
But yes . agree that with the point of view of development since last several years , at several levels many shortcomings have been there , but several works have also been done , with which the beautification of Bikaner improved four folds .
Many people consider Galle located on the southern tip of pearl like Sri Lanka a mixed form of the beauty of Goa and Maldives .
Blue sea seems to be spread infinitely .
The road from Candy to Galle reminds of Goa .
It is like going from Madgaon to Panaji .
Open , flower laden homes like that of Goa .
Construction also almost the same .
Large gardens of coconut and rubber .
If you go ahead then you find greenery on side and emerging sea on the other side .
People also look like our own country - the same complexion , pleasant and mixing in the same way .
Hats are held in the same way as ours .
The way from Candy to Galle going ahead merges with Colombo - Galle Highway .
This is totally beside Indian ocean .
Candy is the heart of Sri Lanka , both in beauty and geography .
While Galle is the tip of Sri Lanka - both in beauty and geography .
Galle is located on the lowest tip of Sri Lanka . little towards west .
We Indians know Galle much for its cricket stadium .
Stadium is also very grand - Galle city on one side , the Galle fort just in front of Pavellion and sea on the left side .
The stadium of Galle is among the good examples of the Tsunami disaster in 2004 and the victory of human will after that .
Therefore it was very fine that reaching Galle we got at first a glimpse of the stadium .
It was preparing itself for the test match starting two days later .
Standing below the Colck Tower of Galle Fort watching the stadium is very mesmerising .
Galle Fort surrounded by the sea on three sides was settled under the control of Portuguese and Dutch .
Most of the buildings inside the Fort show glimpse of hundreds of years old history .
Moving around here it seems as if we are touring an old European city .
High gates , big windows , open courtyards , construction of total European style - in everything , whether it is church or mosque or hotel or courts .
Walking on the wall of the fort from the Clock Tower , there is a different kind of romance in the going towards the light house watching on the one side the old city and on the other side the sea .
The sea is deep just along the wall of the fort .
This would have been the reason for building the fort .
However at some places there are also ladders for getting down .
On the way on the wall several local boys request the tourists to throw coins in the sea .
Behind the coins they also jump in the sea .
The coins brought out from water becomes their prize .
If you go to Lin Ban Street while touring inside the old city of the Dutch Fort of Gaul you will find an art gallery there .
The building where this gallery is in is built in 1763 and it is considered one among the oldest buildings of the fort city .
The building had turned into ruins .
Its present owner Al-Haj M . . . Gaffar brought back its old grandeur - mix of the same old sculpture , color , soil and pearl .
The same kind of wood work .
Even a well of that period in middle of the courtyard has been built again in the same way with lime stone and pearl by digging .
But the most particular thing of this building is its museum .
Several rare and antique items of the period of the Portuguese , the British and the Dutch have been collected here .
It includes jewellery , pottery coins , weapons , cameras , chandeliers and god knows what .
All of these things have been collected from different places and some of these are even goods brought by searching in the deep sea from the ships that sank a long time ago .
Several things are really surprising and the most surprising is the fact that all this formalities are done by the same single person .
All these priceless items kept safely in the almirahs attached all around in several rooms are his own wealth .
Items are so old and rare that estimating their price is also not possible .
Main city is very small .
On both the sides of the city i . . coming back from Colombo and going ahead to Matara or Dondra is the grandest hotel of Galle .
If you move ahead from Galle then on the side leaving Tempobrain island and through Mirisa one can reach Matera .
The Star Fort there is a small but good specimen of Dutch craft .
Fort is built in the shape of star .
Water is filled all around the fort and there is only one bridge to go there which also can be wrapped from the fort itself .
This would have been less of a fort and more of residence of the public officials or at most a post .
Till now it was being watched by a small crocodile which we found taking rest on a rock in the water .
If you move a little more ahead from Matera you will reach Dondra Head .
This is the southern tip of Sri Lanka .
The Light House built here is one among the biggest light houses of Sri Lanka .
Watching the lagoons built along it one gets reminded of the lagoons of Thiland .
The sequence of the rocks break the waves of the sea and the water of lagoon remains calm .
Crashing with those rocks the angry waves get several metres high .
Many times this water creates extremely grand views .
All the coasts present on this southern-western tip of Sri Lanka are particularly popular with the tourists .
This keeps on being the center of several activities throughout the year .
Just near the Dondra Head itself a big statue of Buddha also is counted as one among the highest statues of Buddha of Sri Lanka .
Stay in Galle and get out for some fun and frolic somewhere nearby .
From here one can also go to meet the wild animals of Yala .
If you go to Dondra from Galle itself then whales and dolphins in the sea can be spotted .
Besides this if you wish bird watching can be done in Bundala .
You can go for tour in the jungles of Hiare and Kannelia .
Nature walk can be done in Kottawa and Rumassala .
Till Koggala or Ginganga one can tour on boats .
Water sports can also be enjoyed at different beaches like Haikaduwa or Bentota .
Near Haikaduwa there are extremely grand coral reefs for which tourists come to see through diving .
When we came to sit in the balcony of the hotel then we got to see the sea waving in the front .
This was so much to get touched .
You can experience the warmth of the water oozing out .
One gets to see the beauty of the sea here .
Due to this it is considered to be a competition of Maldives .
All the hotels that are there on the highway from Colombo to Galle , are towards the sea .
Starting from the Taj sea towards the lighthouse and fortress many of the grandest hotels of Sri Lanka are beside the Indian ocean .
One tip of all these hotels keep on playing with the waves continuously .
It is obvious that its swimming pools also touch the sea water .
That is if you are in the pool you will never know when the pool ended and where the sea started .
This is the concept of the Andeles Swimming Pool .
But one more important thing about this part of Sri Lanka which is not visible anywhere else in the world is the stilt fisherman of Galle i . . those fishermen who catch fish sitting on the bamboo standing in the sea .
These fishermen keep on sitting on this bamboo at sunrise and then at the sunset for hours , so that some big fish is caught in the hook .
This has been an old tradition of the fishermen community of this area .
However when and how it started , no body knows it for sure .
Some people say that after the second world war some fishermen used this method for the first time which became a part of tradition .
Its number had started dwindling after the Tsunami that came five years ago .
In an attempt to keep the tradition alive these people have started becoming visible again .
This formality of catching the fish holding hook in the hand sitting on this unusual bamboo in the crazy sea seems to be surprising .
In the morning when we started to walk beside the sea behind the hotel the first glimpse of these fishermen was surprising .
The comfort with which he was smoking bidi taking it out from his bag , see this suddenly it was unbelievable because they were at some distance in water .
How many fish they would have been able to catch and how much that would cater to their and their family 's needs , it was not very difficult to estimate it .
But taking even so much of pains they have kept the tradition alive .
500 families of such fishermen are said to reside in Galle and nearby areas , specially in the Kathaluwa and Ahangama settlements .
This is just a family business which keeps on getting inherited by one generation to the other .
But now this is also a big attraction for the tourists .
Sri Lanka has been considered as one among the most excellent places for spotting Baleen whale .
Due to being affected with the civil war for last several years the tourists have been deprived of this opportunity , but now the atmosphere is calm .
Every year the time from November to April has been considered to be the most appropriate .
The eastern coast of Sri Lanka is the most suitable .
These months the whales go from the southern tip towards the bay of Bengal .
Most of the activities take place in the months of Decemebr and Janury .
The sea is also comparatively calm during these days .
Whales are seen nearby the coast .
At the same time these whales go towards Maldives in the west .
The density of a type of whale in the Sri Lankan sea is one among the most .
The biggest mammal of the world Blue whale is here .
This can be upto 30 metres long and can reach upto a hundred tonnes in weight .
Then fin whale , humpback whale , mink whale etc . area also there .
Besides the whale the number of spinner dolphins is also good here .
These can be spotten on the south-eastern coast of Yala from the Gulf of Mannar to Trincomalee .
Several researches have been conducted about the intelligence of whales , their voice , their food , behavior etc .
Interesting facts are known through these about different types of whales .
Watching them with one 's own eyes is a rare experience .
Well known wildlife photographer of Sri Lanka Gehan Disilva Vijeratne says that watching blue and sperm whale between Mirisa and Dondra Head in Sri Lanka is easier than watching panther in Yala .
Dondra Head is the southern most tip of Sri Lanka .
If you there from Galle then Mirisa falls in between .
That is if you make Galle your base the you plan for whale tour .
If the young generation of country start making such travels then probably there would be no doubt in the predictions of the former president A . . . Abdul Kalam 's Vision - 2020 getting realized .
In a train running from Mumbai has youths in the age group of 20 - 25 , which includes doctors , engineers , MBAs along with educated and little educated people from the rural background .
Going to Pondicherry they start for such a journey that attempts to know the story of success of the unique in itself Aravind Eye Care Hospital .

According to Swapnil Dikshit , the CEO of Tata Jagriti Yatra , by involving the people of small and medium towns and cities in this journey they want to make them experience that they can also do big things .
If anything is needed , it is just the courage .
Famous by the name of Garden City of India , Bangalore is also the capital of information technology .
This is an excellent specimen of unparalelled confluence of traditional and modern architecture .
150 kms away from Bengalooru , Mysore is a unique city of magnificent palaces , gardens spread in large area -LRB- specially Vrundavan Garden -RRB- .
Charming attraction of ancient world is seen far above the modern beauty here .
It is extremely easy to reach favorite tourist places and business houses located in the city from the Ginger Hotel located just 3 kms away from the chief bus stand of Mysore .
A journey of 6-7 hours from Mysore takes you to Mangalore .
The journey of Mangalore is incomplete without the visits to Manjunath Temple built in 10th century , St . Aloysius Chapel , Mangala Devi Temple , Garland of Tipu and Jumma Masjid .
Located in the center of Mangalore city Ginger Hotel is an excellent option for the convinience and comfort of tourists .
The journey of south without Tiruvanantapuram - the city with beautiful beach and temples is quite incomplete .
In the Ginger Hotel located in this city the services like self check-in kiosk , vending machine , gymnasium and cyber café are present .
The Landmark Book Store and Café Coffee Day located in the complex of the hotel are excellent options .
At the shore of Koromandal is Puducherry which is 160 kms away in the south of Chennai .
Synonymous of Spiritual Resort and French Attraction Puducherry is recognized due to Maharshi Aravind and The Mother .
Due to blue deep water of the Andaman Sea it was named Kalapani .
It did not seem possible for the revolutionaries sent by the British to go back .
When the plane is landing the islands , addictive greenery , seashore and pathways start alluring .
There are hundreds of beaches there where you can stay for months .
Someone has said . Going anywhere , we can tour only as along as we are tired . .
If understood , tiredness is a mental state , but for entourage one needs both money and time together .
So when we got both then the Himachali residents like us spent some time away in the green-blue watery complex of Port Blair the capital of Andaman Nicobar .
It was exactly like Keralite did some vagabondery in the high mountains of Kinnour .
Chandigarh Airport is in Renovation Grip .
After security checking the space for sitting particualry during the take-off time seemed falling short .
Use of tractor might be decreasing in lessenning farming but is used much here in pulling luggage .
Seeing the security we felt that if such security is everywhere , then life would be like clear water .
Flight was that of the private company but was late .
There can be several mediums to reach anywhere .
To reach Port Blair it is necessary to board either ship or aeroplane from Chennai , Vishakhapattanam or Kolkata .
It takes about two hours in the air journey of 1200 kms from Chennai .
The journey through ship is between 50 to 60 hours .
When we reached Chennai saying Vannakam i . . welcome then the airport was pensive .
The flight was of four and a half o'clock in the morning .
Night was to be spent drinking tea-coffe and dozing .
Weather adverse to that of North India , flocks of mosquitoes and tasteless tea for thirty rupees .
Since three and half hours in the morning the counter of the private airlines was welcoming with flower bouquets .
When we flew for Port Blair , it was dark .
As we reached near it , light started dawning .
In lap of clouds sitting on the seats of the aeroplane it feels as if we are not flying rather passing through the peels of borax .
Kalapani was also mentioned on the way .
When we reached the hotel the daffodil flowers kept in water inside a round pot of brass welcomed us .
It was necessary to eat after some rest .
In the style of ` Eat of the place where you go ' , we ate tasty food in Vegetarian Annapurna and got ready for vagabondship .
A woman runs this house and she maintained taste and credibility .
So till return , we did not change the place of eating .
National Memorial and Art Gallery reminds of several events like the Andaman Journey of Subhas Chandra Bose and Lahore Conspiracy .
The gallery paintings of several famous painters .
Its main theme is British cruelty , freedom and struggle .
From here we reach the historical jail of Kalapani .
Now it has the hustle and bustle of tourists .
Walking in the Cellulor Jail our generation enslaved by conviniences can not understand how our freedom fighters bore the inhuman cruelties of the British yet never let the desire of freedom lessen .
The mark of the administrative and clever mind of the British shows clearly while watching the jail complex .
Hundreds of the thirteen and half by eight feet wide cells are now silent .
Moving here one gets to easily feel the price of freedom .
There is also a photo gallery here .
There are pictures speaking of forgotten historical events in it .
There are trees of coconut and betel nut in the complex of the jail .
Three side open sea is also here .
It helps make the jail journey of the tourists easy .
In the evening sound and light show is organised in the complex of the jail .
As there was some time for presentation so we came through the sea shore .
Here sea moves all around in each of the streets and colonies .
There thousands of such places where sands are scattered with several shades of rainbow .
Water with god knows how much of depth , innumerous colors and heights keep on kissing it with its waves throughout the life .
Even straight , bent and fallen coconut trees also form unique views .
There is not that much of the crowd of tourists on these seashores spread on the lap of uneven ground .
For the local people this seashore is an appropriate place to sell cocnut water .
We also tasted Jhalmuri .
It is time for light and sound show .
Tourists are entering .
Show is at first in Hindi , then in English .
The expert stage voices like that of Manohar Singh , Ompuri , Tom Alter made the cruel events of the revolution time heart touching .
This union of light and sound is capable of inspiring anyone to be a patriot .
But despite forbidding people kept on recordinig , mobiles kept on ringing , whispering kept on - until they were not forbidden .
It seemed that patriotism now became entertainment .
Next morning tickets to go to Nile Island were booked .
We had to board the ship in the morning .
Watching the sea it does not feel that there are also mountains on the earth .
To reach the islands there are also speed boat and boats for small journeys besides government ships .
Ship ride was safe .
Seeing the life jacket after being seated arouses the feeling of safety .
But only those stay at the seats who commute everyday .
Tourists go on the deck and even above that , where ever possible .
They either honestly imbibe the frolicking waves of the sea or capture them in the pictures .
We reached Nile island famous for its immense beauty .
Having written my on a white paper Viplav was waiting for me there .
Our hearts blossomed to see all this at such a distant place .
Daughter started saying what a welcome ?
Quenching hunger is more necessary than watching beauty .
Lean and thin straight fields of taller trees of coconut and betel nuts are here .
More trees than men - about fourty five hundred .
Laccha Parantha in the hotcase along with coconut sauce and vegetable of dry beans .
Our appetite increased as we saw food .
Mishti Doi doubled our joy .
We also saw signboards of Indian , Continental , Israeli seafood .
There were very few people on the sea shore .
Transparent blue nectar playing near clear shining sand .
With calm water you can be friendly as much as you want , you can enjoy it as much as you want .
We saw elder tourists here enjoying comfortably neck deep in water for long .
People enjoying the magnificent expanse of the sea keep on lying under the trees for hours .
There are more beaches in Nile but the seashore of Bharatpur is incomparable .
We went to the other shores also .
Looking at photographs on returning it seems what waves they were .
We were introduced to the unique world of corals of various kinds some feet underneath deep sea through glass on the plastic boat in sea on the Neel island .
The thrill - loving tourists also get to do snorkelling under the guidance of experienced guides to experience corals and sea life up - close on many shores .
Coconuts were so many that the need for water was not felt .
The water of reddish brown coconut is more sweet .
If the green coconut on tree grows more in size it will taste like coca - cola , it also felt so on drinking .
In the ordinary green coconut sweetness and taste is ordinary .
If grape pulp has to be eaten then a spoon made of coconut will soon be presented .
Health and pleasure both , thirst is quenched as well .
It is possible to stay overnight at Neel but we had to return after noon .
On return journey we touched Havelock island .
There are comfortable overnight stays here also .
After deboarding the passengers and boarding letters at Havelock island when the ship moved towards Port Blair then the colors of evening were descending down on the water .
The moving breeze changed the gait of waves after rain stopped .
The breeze was coming from the front .
Waves troubled , the ship moved slightly up and down .
In such a situation many tourists feel a headache -LRB- sea sickness -RRB- .
If standing on deck then water drowning in deep colors fills every bit of you with fear filled thrill .
Neel to Port Blair via Havelock takes more than four hours .
In this ship staff canteen was also not open , here we realized how important is tea .
Now under Navy , at some time acting as the capital for the British and Japanese , Ross island is neighbor of Port Blair .
Next day ' s journey took us on a trip to three islands but we had to visit only the Ross .
While going the island which is seen towards left is North bay .
Its photograph has been used at the rear side of the twenty rupee note in Indian currency .
We reached Ross in fifteen minutes .
The boat was stopped by throwing a rope on a round iron hook .
Here entry ticket and camera fees are also applicable .
On the ruins of old buildings roots are hinged .
On a mysterious looking historical place was situated a tidal institute .
There only printing house , electricity station , church , bakery , barracks , officers club , water tanks were also made .
Now there are also mango - jackfruit trees on the torn pages of the stories of English lifestyle .
And also dismayed peeping deers , peacocks , Swamp Deer .
They are captured in the present of this place .
One goes to the beach named Ferrar of Ross by descending down several stairs .
Here water seemed to be angry . Here also coconut water remained as the energy source .
When rain came then we reached at the jetty hurriedly .
We had to go to Badoor after noon .
The greenery of farms on both sides of the road and flowers blossomed here and there made the journey convivial .
The devastated households on both the sides made us understand that tsunami ' s effect was still here .
The sand of this shore is coarse wherein aquatic plant Saawla is spread .
They look like soft plastic .
The sea here was angry .
The whole ambience was fragrant by the scented plants of black pepper , clove , mace , cinnamon , betel nut .
In the neighborhood shop here ornaments and other creative products made of pearls and other aquatic gifts are available .
They are sold at expensive prices in city showrooms .
Also saw conch made lampshades , soop walls , bangles and rings during the market visit in the evening .
Had to fly back in the morning .
Heart wanted to stay there for sometime but mind was talking about returning to work .
The air - hostess was telling us with what security measures the aircraft is equipped with .
We all know about the sea shores of Goa .
But Goa ' s another natural face is visible in its thick forests , mountains , waterfalls , and valleys .

Besides gardens , ponds and fish ponds , two monasteries were here wherein a hundred devotees resided .
Here were 30 temples of Brahmin sect .
A 200 feet high Ashoka stupa was there in a huge monastery outside the city .
Besides this there were two small stupas wherein nails and hair of Lord Buddha were preserved .
In these monasteries Lord Buddha gave sermons to people .
In 1868 Sir Alexander Cunningham of the Archaeological Survey of India toured this place but in them he could not find these things especially Lord Buddha ' s nails and hair .
Cunningham came to know of a historical construction at भheemgauda situated at the highest point of this mound .
In the guidance of Chief Archaeological Surveyor Dr . . . Sharma task of limited excavation was started here the goal of which was to know what the shape of the chambers inside the hill was .
In 1966 after limited excavation it was said that due to its historical value it is important to preserve it .
Herein fort like walls dating circa 596 were found .
The miniature work of walls made of attractive bricks is also unique .
Besides this copper coins and copper wares accompanied by carving instrument -LRB- Khakanee -RRB- was found .

A circumambulation path was also found whose major part resembled the construction of the temple .
Utensils made of mud in the shape of a thin wheel were found in a series .
The characteristic of this expedition was that things found here were not found in other excavation sites .
Archaeologists are hopeful that besides the Buddhist stupa described in Huen-Tsang ' s travelogue remains of copper age civilization will also be obtained through excavation at Govishaan mound .
It is of Govishaan said that Lord Buddha had built it approximately 2600 years ago .
Kashipur ' s old fort is known as Ujjain .
Close to which is Dron Saagar .
This saagar is made before the fort .
This saagar was made by Pandavas for their teacher Dronacharya , thus is believed .
Its square area is 600 square feet .
Travellers going to Gangotri come here .
On its banks are memorials of sati women .
This Ujjain fort ' s walls are 60 feet high .
The statue of Jwala goddess who is called Ujjaini goddess is established in the fort of this wall ' s length , breadth and height is respectively : 15 feet × 10 feet × 21 feet .

Through the excavation in Govishaan knowledge can be gained about people staying in the vicinity of Harappan civilization who made articles from pure copper .
In Kumaun copper artists stay even today .
Known as Tamta these artists have been bringing copper wares into use .
Clay artefacts obtained from this place are estimated by archaeologists dating back to 1000 B . . 1500 B . .
Which is a sign that this area might have a relation with Mahabharata period .
Mahabharata ' s warrior Dronacharaya divided this area in the form of North and South Paanchal and made a part of its own kingdom .
There must have been a kingdom of Katyuri kings in the North of Brahampur of this Govishaan .
Huen - Tsang came to Lakhanpur which was the capital of Brahampur .
Huen - Tsang came in the seventh century and returned to China after staying for 16 years .

The mutual identity of South India is either made of its temples or of the sea surrounding it from three sides whose two ends meet at Kanyakumari , but in this counting we usually forget its enormous and grand forest resource .
To forget forests is actually a form of human gratitude equivalent to turn our faces away from our life ' s eternal source .
Forest is the life - source of that concrete urban civilization on which our feet are stabilised , but our tragedy is that we don ' t have time to even think about it .
I believe that if you have not felt the fragrance of forest then probably you have not lived your life completely .
More than at all other places this point is naturally understood while passing through its enormous forests .
These forests filled with wild flowers , fruits , birds and other animals are so dense that till some time before dacoit Veerappan had remained invisible for many years under its shadow .
Sandalwood trees , sources of numerous sandalwood trees , and many spices related our daily life , plants of tea - coffee are spread over in its depth .
You will get filled with the feeling of miracle towards that unique creation of Virat while touching the leaves on its long pathways and drawing its palpating breaths inside yourself .
If this nature is an extension of God then however abstract its worldly existence might be you can see its tangible and direct form in front of your eyes in the heart beat of its forests .
Periyar sanctuary in the Ilaychi Pradesh of Kerala is in the most important national forests of this country and spread around Periyar lake its wide area of 780 square kilometres can be the root of journey spanning many days .
There are also two ways to reach Periyar but we chose the road way of 120 kms from Kottayam railway station .
This way going through Kerala ' s Kanjirapalli city gradually climbs up the mountains covered with tea plantations .
Besides its Nilgiri tea this state is also world - famous for coffee and cardamom plantations .
A little ahead when we traveled through Peermed village then near the road a beautiful waterfall was falling from the mountain .
A little while before Thekdi village worldly circumstances restricted us on the way .
We got to know that all the employees of tea plantations were sitting on strike against their employers .
Among them women had a large number and they along with men were standing blocking the way .
Due to thousand of strikers traffic was blocked a group of policemen were watching spectacle with a helpless look on their face .
We also vehicles kept waiting with all other for the strike to break .
An acquaintance expressing sympathy towards the strike told us that these plantations are very old and after years of exploitation its employees have become a member of a big co - operative organization .
Near Periyar is village Kumili and adjacent to it on the border of Periyar national park is spread the territory of Thekdi where we had set up provision for our stay .
Right in the center of Periyar is a lake around which is spread a dense forest .
During summers when water of all places dry then this lake becomes the only way for animals to quench their thirst .
Seeing the importance of this lake in forest a British Colonel Panikick suggested a dam for Periyar river to increase water and under the supervision of the king of Travankor this dam was made in 1895 due to which the area of Periyar lake increased 26 to 55 km square .
Due to dam a portion of forest did immerse in water but attracted by the rich water of the reservoir many animals started to come towards this forest .
Besides elephants , tigers and other animals were also among them .
Later on it was changed into national park .
Due to increase in the size of the lake the trees which immersed in water , stubs of some of them are visible above water even today and thousands of birds stay on them .
Thekdi village and Kumili village nearby have now adapted themselves as per the needs of local and foreign tourists .
Small - big hotels , tea - shops , restaurants and spice shops have grown here .
There was the empire of greenery till far outside our hut - like cottage standing near the forest .
Golden Oriole sitting on the tree in grove seems to be trying to say something in its melodious voice .
Speaking in a sweet voice this long - familiar bird ' s name is ' Boukathakou ' meaning ' daughter say the story ' .
Many fragrant varieties of wild flowers can be seen grown here and there .
They are wild orchids which are spread in the entire forest .
Their varieties are completely different from flowers of North India .
And along with these you can see beautiful and colorful butterflies going in front of you on the way .
Periyar National park is situated in Kerala ' s Udikki district .
To reach here you can come from Kottayam in west direction at a distance of 115 - 120 kms .
For Kottayam there are direct trains from Delhi , Mumbai and Chennai .
Madurai will be the nearest station from east direction .
One could get buses for the nearest place from Periyar , Kumili from both Kottayam and Madurai , which take almost four hours .
One could get vehicles for Periyar from Kerala ' s tourist place Munnar via Bodinayaknur also .

From Kumili ' s Bus Stand Thekdi is hardly at a distance of 1 kilometre and almost all facilities are available to stay here .

To board the first boat at 7 in the morning it will be important to reach jetty at least 20 minutes before .
In this first boat there are maximum possibilities of seeing wild animals .

The watchman can cook food for you .
Its booking is also done from the Kumili ' s information center and from here only you can arrange for night and day ' s trek .
At the time of going on trek it is mandatory to keep the local guard along and it is also important from the perspective of safety .
Periyar is open twelve moths a year but during rainy season the peril of leeches increase .
In damp and dark areas leech can be found otherwise also .
For this special socks are provided here and a powder which is a mixture of salt and powdered sugar because of which leech do not climb on feet .
Wearing closed shoes would be better to walk in the forest and if necessary then wear socks over them to be safe from the leeches .
Even after this if a leech climbs on you then don ' t worry instead of rubbing it sprinkle salt on it and leave the wound after scraping off the leech , it is not more painful than a mosquito bite .
If you have a few days ' time then you can plan a program to visit Munnar and Kumaarkom along with Periyar .
In Kumili you will get all food items .
While returning from here you can shop for its special Tea , dried ginger and other spices .

Christopher Columbus the discoverer of America found this island in Caribbean sea in 1494 .
In its northern area in the bay of St . Anne he arrived on 4th May 1494 for the first time .
The area where Columbus arrived , Spain has taken some portion of it under its reign .
This part ' s name was Jamaica .
In local language it is called as ' the land of waterfalls ' or ' land of forest and water ' .
In 1509 the arrival of the people of Spain began .
Occupying many other parts they made their administrative capital in Jago de la Vega in 1523 .
From 15th century to 1962 Spanish and British rulers have reigned in Spain .
In the midst of this the British concentrated more on the farming of sugarcane and established many sugar industries .
The increasing demand of labourers in sugar industry gave an opportunity for bonded labor and slavery to flourish .
Considering the lack of labors more than 10 lakh labourers were imported from Africa .
Many of them were sent to other places in America .
During the 17th and 18th centuries these slaves revolted many times .
As a result of this the British government liberated more than 3 lakh labourers in Jamaica on August 1 , 1838 .
With the liberation of a large number of salves there was a scarcity of labourers in sugar industry .
This is why the British thought of bringing inexpensive labourers from India .
On 10th May 1945 first Indian diasporic labourer Parmeshwar stepped on the Jamaican land .
36 , 412 Indian labourers were sent to Jamaica from 1845 - 1917 on contract basis to work in the sugar industry .

Statues found in the land of the districts Sonubigha , Madra , Marui , Samay , Sisvan , Koshla , Patwa Sarai , Maharaawaan , Bermi , Narhat and Makanpur which are adorning the Narada museum are not just very ancient but also present an amazing specimen of art .
Due to this it is being considered as the main center for collection and research of the remains of Magadh - Bang or Pal - Sen art genre .
The genre of this very art was later named as Eastern School of Art .
Narada Museum situated at Nawada crossing at around 125 km far from Patna is today a center of attraction for national and international tourists and researchers due to its unparallel collection of rare ancient sculptures , manuscripts , weapons and tools , art works and coins .
Albeit late , but Indian government ' s attention has come to it .
The scientists of artwork culture research center of Indian National trust for Art and Culture heritage situated at Lucknow has been given the responsibility of preserving the remains and manuscripts of archaeological importance collected here .
Very soon a group of scientists will begin their work here .
Dr . Avadh Kishor Prasad Singh , head of the museum told that idols of Narsingh reincarnate , Natraj , Bodhisattva and Vaasuki are very important from the perspective of science of art .
A plan has been made to conduct research on the idol of Bodhisattva .
Obtained from Haraahi of Vazeerganj of Gaya idol of Hindu goddess Kankali , Padyapaani Avalikiteswar obtained from Kurkihar , Buddhist goddess Hariti obtained from Dhuriyanwa and idol of Hindu Manjushri are extraordinary .
Dr . Singh told us that the description of independent existence of Eastern School of Art can be found in Taranaath .
It has been said in Taranath that during the reign of Pala rulers Devpal and Dharampal , Dhiman and his son Vritpal made many idols .
In the inscriptions of Salimpur there is a discussion of a famous sculptor Someshwar .
It is clear that in Magadh sculpture art was very rich .
The idol of Sun found in Bermi of Nawada district has shoes in its feet .
It is a belief that looking at Sun ' s foot brings bad omen therefore shoes have been worn in the feet .
Head of Bihar Magahi Board , Ram Ratan Prasad Ratnaakar says that the research on Eastern School of Art done till now is incomplete till the time the study of idols of Naarad Museum is not complete .
Due to these reasons Narada Museum situated in the middle of Nawada district is said to be the representative museum for Magadh - Bang genre .
Under the guidance of Indian Archaeological Survey ' s ex - director Dr . Amrendra Nath 2 dozen researchers have researched on Sculpture science here .
He said that this is amongst the major museums in India not only in Bihar .
This museum gives and opportunity for serial development studies .
Officer of the Archaeological department of Patna zone Dr . Jalaj Kumar Tiwari said that it represents ancient Indian sculpture art .
Due to these merits of it Naarad Museum is becoming a pilgrimage for researchers not only from this country but from many countries .
Some time back researchers from Australia and Germany had toured here .
On seeing the collection here they said that this is the main museum of India and there is a need to develop it .
Before this also a lot of researchers have admitted to its importance .
According to Japan ' s Kojee Aamda , this is a better place for research on Buddhist art .
Professor of Art History of Nagoya University of Japan itself has said that statues of Buddhist and Hindu religion of this place are often made available .
After a scrutiny of the museum Prof . Dilip Kumar Chakravarty from Cambridge University remarked like this in the visitor ' s register kept there . have seen many museums in Bihar , out of them this is the best .
Including Korea ' s Namdong Sin . . . ' s Biyan Kistser dozens of foreign researchers have pronounced it as an important center for the preservation of stone age sculptures .
History academician Dr . Rajeev Ranjan from Nalanda University situated in Biharsharif says that the time of Pal was the golden era in the development of Gaya , Nawada and Nalanda .
In Kurkihar and around sculptors used to make sculptures in large numbers .
This is the reason that in this area idols related to Vaishnav , Shaiv , Buddhist , and Hindu religion are found .
Even though Naarad Museum is known for its collection of very ancient art works , coins , manuscripts , weapons and tools but it is young itself .
District officer Narendra Pal Singh established it in a tin shed in 1973 .
He collected ancient sculptures and other objects scattered at Nawada and nearby areas .
Public support enhanced his effort .
In that very year Narendra Pal Singh handed it over to Bihar Archaeology and Museum Directorate and on 2nd May 1974 Governor R . . Bhandari inaugurated it formally .
Uddyan spread in a circular area of 1000 miles is an area of mountains - plateaus and quicksand .
This is primarily the area of Apple farming , where there are thick forests , trees laden with fruits and flowers , gold and iron mines , where both hard cold and summer are intolerable .
This land has also been the birth place of Guru Padmasambhava .
The natives are soft spoken , curious for knowledge and followers of Buddhism .
Around 1400 monasteries are there on the banks of Swat river where once 18 , 000 monks used to stay .
But now majority are deserted .
These Buddhist monks absorbed in chanting follow five thought pillars of ancient belief system - Sravasti Yadin , Dharmagupta , Mahisaska , Kasyapiya and Mahasanghi .
On the banks of Swat 10 temples are situated .
4 . big cities are settled on this shore .
Manglapura situated at the left shore has stayed the capital for majority of kings .
At a distance of 1 mile from here is a large stupa .
In the beliefs of Bodhisattva when Buddha were staying here as Shanti Saint the king Kaali had cut his hands here only .
At a distance of 50 - 52 miles towards north east from Manglapura is a mountain named Naaga Aplaala -LRB- which could possibly be the present Nanga Parbat -RRB- .
Swat river emerges from here .
It is a belief that during the time of Kashyap Buddha it took birth in the human form named as Kingki or Gangi .
He was blessed with a miraculous divine power to lessen the effect of the poisonous dragon -LRB- pardaar naag -RRB- .
Local public used to gift him grains for an entire year .
After a few years when people forgot to give him grains , this Kingki human turned into a dragon .
From whose mouth spewing fire spoiled the entire harvest .
Then Lord Buddha incarnate in the form of Shakya Tathagat with the help of Indra ' s Vajra overpowered this Dragon king .
Even now when every 12 years this Swat river causes a calamity spewing white foam then it is considered the wrath of the dragon king .
People come from far and wide to see Buddha ' s footprints situated at Nanga Parbat .
In the north west of Moongkiyaali is a dark narrow valley of Sindhu .
The way is rocky and sharp which I often crossed with the help of ropes and sometimes with swing bridges made of iron chains .
At many places there were covered foot bridges hanging in the air , under which the river flowed .
After walking about 200 miles I reached Tallilo valley .
This is the original place of Darhad tribe where Daaril river flows .
Fa - Hien called this valley by the name of Tolley .
Saw a 100 foot tall wooden statue of matrayi bodhisattva here , which a sculptor saint by the name of Arhantmadhyantik made .

After leaving Baltistan I went to Gandhaar ' s capital Udakhand also but then after crossing Sindhu reached Takshila .
The width of Sindhu was half a mile .
Any traveller while crossing the river would dedicate any important ingredient to the waves of the Sindhu .
The state of takhshila is spread in the perimeter of 40 miles and capital area 2 miles .

Almost 100 religion followers stay here .
The perimeter of Kashmir state is 1400 miles .
Due to being surrounded by high snowy mountains from all sides this state has always been safe from external attacks .
Before the Mahabharata period it was known as Kashyapur .
Rice farming , fruit laden trees , creatures like cobras and horses , and Kashmir ' s valley laden with medicinal plants is very alluring .
People say that cobra protects the Kashmir valley .
Therefore the natives here are superior , beautiful , knowledge seekers but greedy than people from other states .
To safeguard themselves from harsh winter they wear leather cloths and cover their head with a thin headgear .

The beginning of Christian missionaries going to Himalayan and Tibetan areas started in the first decade of 17th century .
But Antonio de Andrade had the fortune of going to Gunge of Western Tibet or Nari Kharsam region i . . Sutlej Valley as the first European .
In march 1624 walking from Agra after traveling Himalayan area in may - June - July he reached Chhapraang in early August and there from had reached back Agra in November 1624 .
In June 1625 he again headed for Chhaprang from Agra .
In April 1626 he got the first church made .
This year he returned to Agra .
Then other priests went there .
There along with the King many Tibetans had adapted Christianity .
But in the coup of 1630 the converted king and other people were punished .
Here is presented the first journey of Andre which took place from Agra and Chhaprang via Haridwar , Srinagar , Badrinaath and Mana Pass .
For many days I kept waiting for a caravan or an opportunity so that I could enter Tibet .
At this time only was told that the king of Srinagar has given orders to end my journey correctly .
I collected more information about route , whether and obstacles set for Tibet with 2 Christian mates and a guide from Mana .
For two days we kept walking swiftly but on the third day local people came and stopped here who were sent by the state officer of this area .
The path was more difficult ahead .
The snow was many feet deep .
At times we were in snow till chest and at times till shoulders .
At times we would fully stretch on snow and move our hands and legs .
The journey continued till the time we reached the top of the mountain .
Saraswati river takes birth from a snowy pond here .

Downslide began from here and one river came down towards Tholling -LRB- Totling -RRB- .
Tibet ' s vast plateau was in front of us .
Due to continuous snowfall and continuous walking in snow our eyes were feeling a lot of pain .
This was snow blindness .
the way couldn ' t be seen properly .
We could return to Mana in 6 days .
We could return back to Mana in 6 days .
Both my mates were actually tired and filled with pessimism .
I could not move ahead and neither my mates could return back without me .
3 days later a Bhotiya from Mana came in our search who was sent by the villagers .
Due to the fear that Mana people should not be held responsible for the possible mishap in our Tibet journey .
Three days later were successful in making a temporary dwelling in a cave and had reached here only with Manuel Marquez .
Melting of snow was waited for .
When it was time to walk we all were the victims of Snow blindness .
When the local king received the news of our arrival from Tibet then menand horses reached and this way in the beginning of August 1624 I reached Chhaprang in the form of first European .
On the Tanakpur - Pitthaurgarh road 3 kms before Champavat , the historical city of Kumayun , is a village Fullara wherefrom towards the right Giriyagad -LRB- river -RRB- flows from south to north .
Chaekuni village is situated at a distance of two-two and a half k . on the up way after crossing a small bridge built on this river .
On both sides of the way in the large valley step - farms spread their green lustre .
On reaching the border end of Chaukuni on a little plain land on a hill a group of temples of middle age is visible - establishing oneness with the whole of India in its architecture and sculpture style .
It is like a pentagon but in present small temple built on its four sides have been devastated .
Only their foundation stones are visible .
The main temple with line-peak in Nagar style kept in the middle of the campus is facing the East .
In its bottom portion planning there are sanctuary , hiatus and pavilion .
The pictures of four-handed gods and goddesses are engraved along with the ornamentation on the outer walls of the main temple .
The tableaus of the plane above the adytum are also decorated .
Godly figures and other ornamentations are also engraved on the trifloral chandramala of half pavilion .

Chest , both the left arms and feet are broken .
In the lower part the broken leg is resting on a bull .
On the left is a lion figure .
The main Figurine of Paravti has some Nepali effect on it .

She is exhibited wearing circular petal earrings in her long ears , necklace in neck , bhujband near elbow , and bangles in wrist .
There is an eroded idol of a bull in the main chamber .
Its main figurine has become completely unclear .
Stone strips on the main temple ' s main gate are carved by the rhythmic decorations of flower vines .
Chaukuni Gram has been famous by the name of Chaukuni Bohra .
It was told that towards 10 steps behind the main temple is another temple of the same size .
Along side was a huge ' Khadik ' tree like a canopy .
While blasting this temple this tree fell down .
Some people used the foundation stones of temples in their homes and some for the boundaries of their farms .
During the prosperous days of Champavat this ancient temple group must have been very important for praying .
it is completely deserted in the present times .
Villagers do not have any devotion towards this temple group .
In village the fashion is to pray very small devsthaan .
Kuldevi is also prayed and sacrifices are also given .
The land of this temple is used after cleaning for the annual fair of the village otherwise there are no other means for its maintenance .
In the district of Pithoragarh besides other statues independent statues of sheshshayi Vishnu are available in abundance in temples and .
In Uttrakhand these idols are still available in the genre of middle ages and local folk art genre as well in the temples of highly inaccessible villages .
Bilveshwar mahadev in Pitthauragadh ' s Vishaad village and in Nakuleshwar also idols of anantshayi Vishnu have been prayed .
Many idols are being worshipped as the background gods in the ancient temples of Baskuni and Madgaon village of Chamdeval region .
The journey from Pitthauragarh to Lohagarh to reach chamdeval has been an experience worth remembering for a long time .
While living in Dehradun my mind overwhelmed by the Himalayas was always longing to travel in the Himalyas .
First from Nainitaal to Pitthaurgarh via Almora and then from Pitthaurgarh to Lohagad .
Thick forests of Deodar , wide valleys , high mountain ranges .
The gaze would be focussed there only .
Walking a little after getting down from the vehicle a completely whitewashed huge temple -LRB- height about 30-35 feet -RRB- built in Pirha Tube style at the border of the village itself in the background on a high platform automatically attracts attention .
Nearby on a board is written . Chaumu Chaukhaam God - five gem temple - Village Sabha Baskuni ' .
This ancient temple complete with an adytum , ardhamandap and a cell .
In the adytum Shivling rock and Trishul are enshrined .
Along with the local ' Choumu ' God , the idols of Sun , Goddess Durga , Sheshshayi etc are worshipped in the temple as background gods and goddesses .
In order to reach Madgaon one has to go by climbing up and down on an almost one k . . stretch from Chamdewal to hilly trails of land and rams of land etc .
Some excited people in the village also became our way - demonstrator .
Far at a deserted place when we asked what the name of this place was then we got to know that it is known as Gumdesh .
Till far a settlement could not be made out .
In a way a person walking in this area looks like he is lost that is why it is named as Gumdesh .
A lot of stories must be associated with this state which we would be able to know only when we stay here for a few days .
A little ahead of Gumdesh is downslide then in a strip of a beautiful valley Mudgaon is settled in Shillong .
Departed for Singapore from Delhi on 11 August 1988 .

Darwin looked like the Indian town in the hot jeth month .
My reservation was in the tourist house .
After freshening up I went straight to Beufort center the spot for World Conference .

After River tour , seeing cave art of El Seraana and going through Pine Creek road , we people came to Indith shore for night stay .
This was the most beautiful spot till now .
Around the lake made of a huge waterfall was complete reign of nature except the camping arrangement .
After putting a mosquito net on the land with the support of bushes we took a short nap .

Australia is the home of white lead where its 500 species can be found .
Trees of some species out of these are as high as 90 metres .
The wood of Jaara species is the hardest .
The shape of some trees are like banyan , jamun , neem and tun trees .
In areas abundant in safeda complete scarcity of birds and animal was visible despite that in Australia mammals of 230 kinds , same number of kinds of lizards , snakes of 140 kinds , tortoise of one and half dozen variety and many kinds of fishes are found .
All these creatures are found in fertile areas only .
The white area looks like a desert .
Although three fourth Australia is dry today and the entire population stays in the plains of beach area but in the past Australia was far more succulent as it is known from the huge dried ponds and skeletons .
During the stay in Australia met Indians in Darwin one evening also who had invited us on dinner .

First of all on the front page Australia in black , red divided in these two strips and an orange scorching sun in the middle were shown .
It is the symbol of tribal flag .
Below at one side was Black Australia painted and on the other side was completely white Australia which was denounced .
In the newspaper news about the still prevailing bias and suppression were published .
One black sister had exposed the colonial suppression in her autobiography titled My Story .
Another black brother had made a film by the name of White Man wherein the European civilisation was torn to pieces .
On this diwali holidays I went to Barman Ghaat .
It is a beautiful pilgrimage situated at the shore of Narmada .
One day taking a local friend along I set out to visit villages nearby .
In one village there was an ancient chateau of some Gaund king .
I started sketching the village after climbing on that .
I saw that a villager was looking at me with doubtful eyes .
He left after a while .
We got down on the completion of the sketch .
Had just reached the border of the village when saw a man with a stick walking swiftly towards us .
A huge crowd had gathered outside the house of Malgujaar .
That villager was also among them .
Giving an explanation I said I am an artist .
I am an art teacher .
I have a hobby of writing also .
During holidays I leave to roam on the shores of Narmada .
I make pictures of Narmada ' s life .
Finally one day I departed for Putlikhoh with that friend of mine .
Took an informant along .
Sometimes through mountains or forests , at times through the sorghum - millet farms then at times through the high edges of Narmada we reached Kerpaani in the evening .
On reaching there we came to know that Putlikhoh is 6 kms far from here .
We had come walking around 22 kms .
We were tired and hunger was also troubling us .
But the attraction of Putlikhoh was so strong that we left on an empty stomach with a local informant along .
Putlikhoh is in such an inaccessible area that if we had bothered about food then we would not have been able to see it .
A mountain waterfall has made its way through two mountains .
Putlikhoh is in this waterfall and the way to reach it is also this waterfall .
This waterfall has become narrow ahead .
Standing edges on both the sides .
Going through the huge flagstones from the side of the picturesque waterfalls .
Here it flows between entirely flat rocks .
Throughout the year cold clear water stays here .
On one side of the waterfall is a 50 meter high standing edge .
This is Putlikhoh .
Dampened my handkerchief from the water of the waterfall .
Then I kept looking at the horizontal layered rocks of a standing edge .
Then started caressing the rocks with the wet handkerchief .
I kept looking in awe .
At one place after the rock was wet many figures started to emerge .
When I saw it from close my happiness knew no bounds .
They were rock paintings made some 20 , 000 years before from today .
Due to sun , rain and air they have faded but when a wet cloth is caressed over it then they are visible again .
These pictures are made on horizontal layers of rocks .
The width of the layer is eight or nine inches .
This is why the height of pictures is six or seven inches .
All pictures are made of light red ochre color .
In rock art usually animal , warrior or prey is registered .
The atmosphere here is different .
Holding each other ' s hands human figures are either dancing or going somewhere .
At one place more than 30 figures have been registered in one line only .
Such a simple , lively and natural illustration of a dance festival in the form of a panel will probably be found elsewhere .
Figures are of two kinds - Obese and emaciated .
The caravan of obese figures is going somewhere one behind the other .
People think of it as an army here .
The shape of emaciated figures is like a Damru .
They have held each other ' s hand .
They seem like dancing .
Unfortunately due to the water leaking from the rocks at the top the heads of all figures have faded .
I designed some figures .
It was getting dark so we returned .
Went again in the morning .
Chitronvali edge had bathed in the sun .
I made some more imitations .
Most pictures are usually at a height of 1 . or 2 metres and this is why can be seen easily .
After looking at them to our heart ' s fill we set to return back to Burman ghaat .
I was thinking that the number of samples of prehistoric art that can be found in Madhya Pradesh are nowhere else .
Exciting point is that all these places are either in Narmada valley or near Narmada .
Putlikhoh is only 6 kms away from Narmada .
.
Zanskar ' situated in north-western Himalaya is the most parched and cold state of the country .
This terrain spread over approximately 3 thousand square metres is surrounded by Kashmir in the North - west , Lahol in the South , Tibet in the East and Kishtwar in the West .
Two world famous Himalayan peaks ' Nun ' and ' Kun ' are existent in this state .
For this reason , apart from natural beauty , Buddhist caves and ancient culture this area is a prime example of mountaineering also .
In the winter season due to excessive snowfall the Zanskar area becomes very cold , impassable and absolutely like desolate .
Before being the rule of the rulers of Dogra of Jammu - Kashmir in 1834 Zanskar was an independent state within Ladakh .
Zanskar area also kept being known by the name of Little Tibet .
The villages of Zanskar state are situated primarily in the valleys of two major rivers Doda and Lingti and their tributaries .
There is a clear effect of the geographical location and climate of this place on the places chosen for establishing villages , clothing of men and women , religious festivals , worshipping practises of gods and goddesses and ceremonial conventions .
The social and religious lives of people is regulated by the worship of temples .
Genteel art and cultural .
The means of life maintenance in Doda and Lingti village is extremely limited .
The art , tradition of these villages seems to have been started in the first millennium A . . by local animal-tenders .
The remnants of art in certain places in the impassive roads are existent in the form of those rocks , on which the pictures of reindeer , deer , group dances , chase scenes , horses etc . have been etched .
On the advent and spread of the Buddhist religion the major topic of this art tradition and Buddhists monks and local .
Undoubtedly the ruins of the above mentioned art on the inaccessible roads are proof of the fact that in ancient times spread and expansion of Buddhist religion and culture in Tibet and Central Asia would have taken place through the medium of this very period .
There is important contribution of this art tradition on local development also .
Apart from this its clear influence has fallen on the economic and cultural sides of Danda and Ligli villages .
Along with the spread of the Buddhist religion in the Kushan age the Indian styles of art rose at Mathura and Gandhar .
Apart from the pre-existent art of this place the influence of Mathura and Gandhar styles can also be seen on Buddhist art .
These art patterns are seen carved on the large stones in the Maitrey and statues of the Dhyani Buddhist creed located at several places like Karshekhar , Vyamakhar , Sumdhung , Sani , Phe , Tonde , Jangla , Muni etc. .
The religious significance of these places was continuously maintained and later in about the 9th - 10th century inspired by the Tibetan Buddhist tradition many caves were constructed .
In this art a great Tibetan scholar teacher ' Rinchen Gumpo ' in this area along with the construction of monasteries and temples made a collection of incantations and Tantric books .
The most ancient and attractive Buddhist cave constructed by Guru Rinchen Gumpo is situated in Samuda .
Constructed in approximately the 10th century the dukhang of this cave is considered unexcelled for its unique and attractive decoration .
In it on the branches of the tree a constructed in Lhasa and five meditating Buddhas are displayed in an impressive manner .
The monasteries and temples of Samuda hold a similarity to the Buddhist temples of Alvi in structure and design .
To reach here one has to come via Alvi and according to an adage Guru Rinchen Gumpo had reached Samuda by that route only .
Jankhul cave , is situated approximately 33 k . . east from Padam on Padam - Kishtwar road .
This is famous in the entire region for its unparalleled art works and wondrous incidents .
According to tradition it is believed that in the 8th century the maximum part of Ladakh had got flooded .
At that time Guru Naropa had sat at this stone and done deep meditation .
His footsteps are still present on the stone .
In approximately 15th century the construction of a five storey temple was done adjoining that stone , which goes upward gradually along with the height of the stone .
In the fourth floor is that part of the stone on which are drawn the foot signs of Guru Naropa .
In spite of its natural architecture also this cave of Jankhul lends vivacity to its lonely atmosphere .
The walls of the cave are painted with Buddhist gods and goddesses and incidents .
Here in the Pujas the famous gurus of Ladakh , Tibet , Zenskar and Bhutan , temple constructors , painters and rare idols of the composers of Buddhist works have been kept .
Among these the statues of Guru Rinchanjangpo , Fyagaspa Sherap and Chherring Dorje have their own unique attraction and importance .
The Buddhist memorial of Sani approximately at a distance of 12 k . . from Padam is famous for its art .
On the rock slabs located in the middle of the village , the statues of Maitrey , Buddha and Awalokiteshwar have been sculpted .
They are worshipped even today .
In the Indian art styles in these idols the coordination of Mathura and Gandhar is seen .
Apart from these idols the world famous ' Kanika ' chorten of Sani attracts everybody by its shape and architecture .
Otherwise the establishment of this Stupa has been linked to the rule of Kanishka , but on the basis of architecture this can not be thought to be before the 7th - 8th century .
An idol of Guru Naropa is installed in the miniature temple attached with the Stupa .
Small cells of another ancient temple located in the side of the temple has been decorated with the statues of Buddhist deities and walls have been painted with the life events of Padmasambhav .
It seems by these pictures that their artists must have stayed in Kashmir Gate because picturesque description of Kashmir has been done in the background of the pictures .
In the Buddhist temple of Sani a grand idol of Buddha of gold is placed .
In the 15th - 16th century it had been made into two parts by dacoits but they stole away only the lower heavy part and left the upper part here itself .
Today the same upper part has been joined with the lower part constructed by Stacko and the entire idol been kept in the temple .
The temple constructed on the summit of the mountain situated in ' Fey ' village is also considered to be of the time of Rinchen Zangpo .
The most important attraction of this temple of Fey village are the soulful depiction of incidents of the life of Buddha .
In these the sight of the head shaving of Buddha has become very poignant .
These wall paintings have been made by Master ` Fyagaspa Sarop ' .
Sir Aurel Steine in his book ` Ancient Khotan ' has given the details of Keshmundan pictures of Buddha and according to him it has a glimpse of the Indian Gandhar style of the fourth - fifth century .
Apart from this a coordination of the arts of Kashmir , Indian , Middle Asian and Tibet is also found to be seen in the pictures in this temple .
Ancient relics are existent in the ' Karsa ' village situated on the mountain in front of Padam .
Apart from the remains of the forts in Karsa village are some Buddhist temples .
These frescos of the temples of Karsa village seem to be of the time of Rinchen Zangpo .
Five meditating Buddhas are painted on the walls of the chortens situated in Karsa village .
The present cave of Karsa is the biggest , most important and valuable cave .
There is adequate arrangement for staying of approximately 200 lamas in the present cave of Karsa .
After the 13th century the monasteries , temples of Ladakh and Zenskar had to go through the phase of external attacks , by which a lot of damage was caused to them .
In this time dacoits took away innumerable rare idols and only some important Buddhist temples remained .
During this dacoity all monasteries , temples and houses of Kargil , Suru , Sod , Batalik and Chigtan area got destroyed .
Most monasteries - temples of Zenskar were saved because of the impassable and safe geographical location .
The invaders could not proceed beyond Parkacha .
After the 15th - 16th century the maximum influence of Tibetan architecture and worshipping practices was felt on the Buddhist tradition of Zenskar , whose imprint can be seen seen in the monasteries and temples make at that time .
Apart from this from the point of view of safety also most monasteries , temples of Aslam had been made on the summits of mountains .
Lohsar ' the festival of new year celebrated in the winters fills them with such enthusiasm that they forget the chilling cold of 400 also .
But because of financial pressure , modern tourism and the impractical policies of development the tradition of preservation of an ancient culture and Buddhist memorials is going on being affected .
After the severe struggles of the entire day , after dealing with the dinner - washing , these mothers knitting carpets for so long could laugh wildly and could happily answer our every question .
It is apparent in all these journeys the mention of ' Kaddali Festival ' used to come in now and then .
We had promised many families that no matter what happens , we would come to Chaudans at the time of Kaddali .
Elders used to bless that ' Badwa Shyangshe ' keep you safe , this earth will definitely call you no matter what happens .
Now we had a small daughter Sunanda also who had just celebrated her second birthday .
We were concerned about her health but we had to participate in this joyfulness of ' Shauka Samaj ' - that Shauka Samaj which was like our second family .
In Dharchula our beloved and respected Shri Jawahar Singh Nabiyal and Shri Harish Rautela used to continuously make available to us through letters every small and big information .
Kaddali Mahotsav was to happen in October 1999 , which was coming after a gap of twelve years .
In Dharchula Nabiyalji and Rautelaji had with great intimacy cared for us three , like always .
On the left side of the entrance door of the great camp of Juna Akhara there is a great crowd .
A small banner is saying that this is the place of Urdhvabahu Baba .
An emaciated , Digambar , elder Baba is sitting to one side of the Dhuni .
Some foreign girls were serving Urdhvabahu Baba .
On the spread feet of Urdhvabahu Baba common Indians are repeatedly touching their heads in respect .
The right hand of Urdhvabahu Baba is constantly upright in blessing .
With the left hand Urdhvabahu Baba is applying ash on the foreheads of the troubled Indians and beating their troubles .
It is half past eleven at night , when I am returning to media camp from the world of Akharas based on Ganga .
Outside the entrance doors of the Akharas the group of band - people are rehearsing for the procession of the royal bath of tomorrow morning .
The whole Kumbh city is bathed in the dazzle of light .
Here it does not seem that there is heavy crisis of electricity in the state .
Continuous electricity is being given to the Kumbh by cutting from industries , offices , cities .
On crossing Pantun bridge a heavy crowd of people sleeping - waking on the sand , lying twisted .
The crowd is awaiting the break of dawn , when the Sun will enter the Capricorn constellation and they will take a dip in the Sangam .
There is such impatient , such thrilling , such heated wait for this moment by them that the dripping dew from above and the wet sand from below also does not produce any chill .
I am shivering despite the warmth of walking on foot only .
It is very cold but had a good sleep inside the Swiss cottage of the media camp .
Friends woke me up at 4 o ' clock then the roaming -LRB- both of the body and mind -RRB- tiredness of the previous day was filled in my body .
But had to get up and walk towards the shore of the Sangam .
Today is Makar Sakranti - the first royal bath of the Kumbh .
From five o'clock various processions of Akharas will leave for bath at the Sangam .
Before this had gone for the Kumbh of Haridwar -LRB- 1998 -RRB- but this would be the first opportunity of seeing the royal bath .
At half past four we were outside the media camp .
The crowd of bathers was going on the Red road . long , homogeneous affair of men - women .
Some people had bags in their hands and some had goods filled gunny - bags on their heads .
Some had held the hands of children tightly and some had held small kids .
People are going continuously - taking long steps , murmuring something or the other .
Standing in wonder in front of the camp we were listening to snippets of all the languages of India so many languages .
Some were laughing and joking , some were scolding their group and some were going along singing hymns .
We also gel in this crowd , it is just dusk now and we also met with a lot of people coming back after Makar Sankranti bath .
It seems that after midnight only the bathing had begun .
The actual shore of the Sangam remains reserved for the Akhara of royal bath , so those who have to bathe at the Sangam - nose they bathe at two - three at night itself .
People coming after bathing are very satisfied and are watching the crowd going for bathing with pride .
Seeing their satisfied walk the people going for bath get even more impatient .
The footsteps of the people going for bath becomes quicker .
Hurry and worry surround them .
There was so much crowd that fear started .
Stampede and accidents are not uncommon for Kumbh .
On the expanse of the Sangam shore appearing ahead its as if the whole of India spreads out in front of the eyes .
There is hardly any corner of the country from where the people have not come to this Kumbh .
People all around .
Going on bathing .
Come after bathing .
Lay down , sat up .
Got their heads shaved .
Did libation .
Cooked food .
Ate meals .
Rolled at the feet of priests .
Searched for lost ones .
Cried .
Opened the bundle of difficulties .
Searched for moksha in the waters of the Sangam .
People are bumping into one another .
They have no relation within themselves .
They are not even recognizing each other 's voices .
But today , here in this Kumbh they are in a strange way looking one .
This Kumbh , this Ganga - Yamuna , this Makar - Sakranti .
They are joined in one string .
They have made a large country .
This is India .
Am I being emotional ?
Is any wave soaking me too in the Kumbh ?
But what I am seeing is the truth .
This truth is in front of me .
Lucknow - Delhi - Mumbai - Kolkata is not India .
Allahabad is not India .
But this Kumbh is India .
This is not just a crowd .
The dawn is receding .
The first feel of the light fills these people with even more commotion .
Dawn was breaking .
The Capricorn constellation is about to welcome the Sun .
Simultaneously a collective hail resonates in the ears ' Har - har Mahadev , har - har Gange ' .
In the camps across the Ganga the arriving of the Akharas had begun .
The random tunes of the band have begun to get louder like noise .
The zeal is increasing in the media people spread out here and there on the Sangam shore .
The policemen have become energetic .
The fair authorities , commissioner and S . . . proceed towards the Pantun bridge with flower garlands .
They have to do a formal welcome of the arenas .
We wanted to tear the crowd and reach the corner of the procession road .
For the blessed returns of seeing the royal processions of the arenas the public is sitting stuck to each other since midnight .
It is very difficult to cross this crowd mutually stuck with belief .
Seeing the procession of the hermits the crowd is emotional .
Again and again they are folding hands .
Respect is oozing in their eyes .
Their faces is shining in a blessed manner .
When they cry the slogans of Hail Mahadev , Hail Ganga then automatically would get up half from their seats .
These are destitute people .
This is the Indian middle class .
They are always behind railing , brims and barricading like they are at this time imprisoned behind the fences fixed on the procession road .
But they are blessed from there .
One procession has passed .
The second one will come when this will have bathed .
In the midst of this suddenly there has been some stir in the crowd that was sitting quietly till now near the poles .
Shifting from the midst of the poles , saving themselves from the view of deployed soldiers suddenly many people had reached the procession road in the middle .
Some of them are filling the dirt of the procession road in anjuli , some are pouring it on their heads , some are rolling over there .
It took a little time to understand that they are taking the feet dust of the hermits - saints .
The police constables are slamming batons , are abusing but not only men , women are also rolling on the road and not leaving their chance to do their country - paradise gratitude .
Maybe this will not give lesser blessings than taking a dip in the Sangam .
When the sound of the next procession approaching was heard then the police showed their true form .
Then the spectators went back behind the poles .
Seeing the Sangam bath of the Akhara is also an experience .
With the feeling of respect , absolute satisfaction that the crowd takes dips , not only the body , it purifies the body - soul inside .
I have not seen saints bathing like that .
There was hardly any saint who did not dip up to the neck or head .
After bathing when they were standing for return then I did not see water dripping from their tangled hair .
Actually , in the way they were taking the Kumbh bath , it was not like earning blessing , but looting the blessing .
They were aggressive .
Shankaracharya had built these Naga Akharas for the protection of religion .
That is why today they are winning the blessings with their weapons on the chest of Ganga .
They are protecting religion .
A huge party of national - international media is immersed in capturing in cameras this miraculous sight of the bath .
In the midst of the first rays of the Sun bursting from the horizon the bath of the Naga - saints , then smearing ash on the body at the shore and standing waiting for return - is a unique sight for the cameras .
Foreign media is clicking and shooting here and there like mad .
They are going absolutely close to the Naga saints and taking close - ups .
Famous for anger Naga saints are in an amused mood today .
They are giving different poses to the foreigners by the time of the coming of the Kumbh of the twenty first century the saints have become ' media - savvy ' .
Some enthusiastic cinematographers went far in the water of the Ganga and took position and stood before the Sangam entry of the Naga saints .
The Akharas did not object at this .
Otherwise no one else can even enter in the Sangam before them at festive bathing .
The poor masses are left searching for blessing and redemption quite far from the ' real Sangam ' at the shores of Ganga or Yamuna .
For the media also this was really Mahakumbh -LRB- the great Kumbh -RRB- .
Where will one get so many stories and so many sights together in the world .
That is why the media of the entire world , independent journalists , even ' paparazzi ' have positioned fronts in this Kumbh .
Only the information department has made three large camps for the media .
Media persons are present in heavy numbers in personal pandals , arenas , hotels .
From morning to late night they kept accumulating some or the other valuables .
Here from ' Nude Saints ' and ' Bathing Beauty ' to ' Clad Mystery ' and ' Supernatural Powers ' everything is available easy , enough and free .
In this even national media is not behind .
The photographers have booked the boats in which they are roaming and capturing bathing women from different corners .
Volunteers of different institutions deployed for arrangement on the Sangam banks are not only watching such scenes themselves very concentratingly but also show good shots to the camerapersons around .
In the Kumbha of 1977 Nirmal Verma in a description written for Dinaman had said at one place . have never seen the policemen so disciplined in life .
The entire battalion is watching the bathing women continuously .
Since 2001 I am seeing equal form of discipline in not only policemen , servants themselves , journalists and salvation workers .
A crowd of lakhs is present today on the Sangam shore -LRB- in this the wharf of this and that side of Ganga - Yamuna are also included -RRB- .
It is the initial estimation of the administration that almost one crore people will bathe the Kumbh on Makar Sakranti .
At the bath of the biggest , silent new moon there is an estimation of three crore people coming .
The approximation of so much crowd is also producing terror .
I am getting pushed and roaming in this crowd .
When I am not bathing in some or the other wave of the Kumbh then I would be feeling scared .
God knows when there could be a stampede .
Tingling happens .
But the fair of Kumbh is so diverse and queer that fear does not remain for long .
Some or the other goods , some or the other news distracts attention .
If you escaped from the boatmen insisting on getting you bathed on the Ain Sangam or rather Triven then the barbers of ` Nai Bada ' invite with great request to get shaved or tonsured .
For ten rupees they will shave the head and beard free alongside .
Otherwise five rupees for shaving the beard .
The barber shop has been made by surrounding with poles .
In which hundreds of barbers are gossiping .
Many people , husband - wife and children are walking tied together with the ends of dhoti or sheets .
There is great fear of separating in the crowd .
That is why this arrangement .
Announcements about lost - found people are continuously happening on the central transmission system of the Kumbh .
Lost people are calling to their friends in their language .
The wistful cries of lost people in diverse languages on the loudspeaker also creates terror .
There are two camps in the Kumbh area by the name of ' lost - found ' .
Both are filled .
The view of the Kumbh from Shastri bridge is even more strange .
The flow of the Ganga cuts towards the city .
That is why on the other shore , towards Jhunsi a large field of sand has grown .
On this field this time Kumbh settlement has been based .
All arenas , camps , exhibitions , all types of pandals are all there .
Sangam shore meaning this end has been left fully empty .
Where a crowd of fifty lakhs can easily assimilated .
That is why the Kumbh is appearing very organised this time , looking above immeasurable crowd seems to be crawling like ants .
If the arrangements are strong then the Kumbh really fits in this Sangam shore in Prayag .
In Haridwar it shrinks - collapses .
I had thought the Sangam shore would be deserted today .
After the royal bath of yesterday his condition would be like ploughed battle field .
That is why in spite of excessive exhaution we went in the morning to the Sangam shore .
But it was definitely not found deserted .
The crowd of bathers is all around .
Yes , there is no chaos of the crowd . Sangam is not ` royal ' but of common people .
Women are drying their cloths in the wind after bathing .
Rainbow waves of colors are rising - falling .
We went to the middle of Sangam taking a boat .
Taking a boat we went to the middle of Sangam .
There is a good crowd of bathers in the middle of Sangam .
The constables of water - police are alert and are controlling - regulating the boaters .
Our boat man shows us the meeting line of Ganga - Yamuna .
The color of Ganga is dirty - brown .
Its flow is also fast .
Yamuna is calm - deep .
The color of the water is green wherever Yamuna is meeting Ganga , as if a line has been drawn .
This meeting can be seen clearly .
Yamuna is joining Ganga with a lot of love .
There is no resistance , no bet . silently get merged .
Such a large Yamuna , how it mixes its identity in Ganga .
This surrender is unique .
The number of times of Prayag came , Sangam went , the same experience happened .
Two days after the first royal bath the camps of Akharas and religious associations of hermit - saints became the den of politics .
The second royal bath is on 24 January .
In between this on 19 - 20 January the religious committee of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad is going to happen .
That is why there is a lot of opportunity for politics and polarisation .
Although the coming - going of bathers at Sangam and the shores of Ganga - Yamuna is underway continuously .
The focus of the media has shifted from the shores because instead of the Sangam of respect there is more spice in the slime of politics .
After the afternoon we took leave from Kumbhnagar .
In the return towards Lucknow the Kumbh kept following till some time .
Then slowly that work - business began to ride on the heart and mind .
For which we were returning .
The statue began saying that how in R . . . . young scientist has discovered the formula of polythene eating moss .
After the publication of his this observation in ' Nature ' sensationalism spread .
Things from everywhere , one after the other , mutually related and unrelated also .
Nandadevi Rajjat ' is one of the major popular festivals of Uttarakhand .
Jat starts from Nanda Siddha Peeth Kurud and Kansuwa in Chamoli -LRB- not from Nauti as is propagated -RRB- .
Besides this Dashamdwar Doli Kandara and Jwalpa Doli merge with Swali Village in Rajajat .
More than about 200 Chantolian , Devi Nishan and thousands of children , old , women - men and daughters go to Kailas -LRB- Hemkunt 4200 m -RRB- to see of Nanda .
Nanda Raj Chhantoli from Almora and along Nanda Katar from Kot Bhramari Temple of Garud people participate in Jaat .
It is estimated that around 10 thousand devotees completed the inaccessible journey of 280 kms in 19 camps which possibly is one among the most difficult religious travesl of the world .
Shri Nanda Devi Rajajat 2000 started from the princes ' village Kansuwa on 21 August and by seeing off Nanda on 6 September 2000 in Homekund the Mahakumbha of the Himalayas ended on 10 September in Nanda Temple Nauti and Nanda Siddhapith Kurud .
The Temple of Nanda is located at a distance of 25 kms from Nand Prayag on the Kunabgad Tok of the Kurud village in the left side of Bhadragad emanating from the Bhadra Mountain -LRB- 3322 m . -RRB- .
The neighbouring villages of Karud are Sung , Charbang , Ludtara , Ghargaon , Kumjung , Sung Mathkot and Farkhet .
Nanda temple is on an open flat place in an attractive ambience .
According priest Jivaram Gaud at a time this temple was towards the other side of the valley at the top of the Luntara village at a desolate place but when buildings started being built above the goddess temple then the goddess became angry and came towards the left side of Bhadragad .
But it seems that this must have happened by a landslide .
Even today the sign of the landslide is clearly seen .
In front of the temple there is a bird 's eye view of the Nandakini valley .
All around mountains decorated with pine , acorn , deodar etc increase the beauty of the temple .
The temple constructed with local stones is like common Uttarakhand temples .
There is a square sanctuary and a small assembly booth outside .
According to Goud priests there is a self-emanated Nandi idol in the temple .
This idol is buried in the earth and its 4 . inches part is above the ground .
Beside the temple are two small temples of Lakshmi and Narayana .
In the Nanda temple premises itself there is a heap of stones which is called the place of Latu the eloquent brother of Nanda .
An old tree of cypress is in the temple compound , in which a swing of iron is lying and swinging here is of great value .
The temple 200 metre below is joined to the road by a 6 foot solid concrete path .
In the Karud Nanda temple a fari took place for three days , in which statues were installed in the temple bringing from the priests ' house and ` Chausingya Khadu ' -LRB- Medha -RRB- coming from Charwang was welcomed in the temple .
On 23rd the cultural program and on 24th the completion of the fair happened .
On 25th there was the most crowd in the temple .
Chantolis coming from outside were welcomed and Jaat departed from Kailas -LRB- Homekund -RRB- .
People from various places sang songs and hymns , hailed the Nanda gathered in the temple premises .
The priests came to the temple compound bare feet wearing a white dhoti , white kurta and a turban on his head in Rajasthani style .
There was unparalleled enthusiasm in the crowd .
Drum , Damaus , bhaunkaras , bells , gongs started playing .
In the midst of the conch shell melody the goddess descended on the main priest Jeevram Gaur .
Pashwa was covered with a bordered sheet .
The priests danced on the shoulders of the followers .
Wishes were given for the purpose of the journey of the Jaat .
With the shower of akshatas on the devotees by the priests the Jaat got the permission to depart .
The palanquin of the goddess left borne on the shoulders of the followers .
The Jaat left for Bhenti morning 10 o'clock from Ustoli .
Sarpadi ' village came on the way , where there was arrangement of tea - snacks .
The male - female students of the junior and elementary school Sarpadi were standing queued .
Flowers were being showered on the Chantoli and the palanquin .
The next day there was lunch for the travellers in ' Lakhi ' village .
The responsibility for this was being taken by the principal of the Inter College Indra Singh Farswad .
The rain beginning at Sarpadi had become quite torrential by the time we came to Lakhi .
The palanquin reached the village at 12 . 15 .
All rushed into houses .
The temple of Goril , Hati Devi and Pandavas are in the middle of the Sar of the fertile village Lakhi .
The biggest village of the area of 300 mawasas is influenced by the landslide .
This rain year a person died due to landslide .
The Jaat started in the rains only for Bhenti .
There was only water on the road .
All travellers are afraid of leeches .
People coming from field areas jump and fling their legs on a leech sticking , but remain unsuccessful .
Then Dimri ji of the S . . . medical team told that apply salt on the leech and get rid of it .
Then we got relief .
We reached Bhenti village in the evening .
There were very less villagers .
It came to be known that maximum villagers have gone taking their animals in the thatch in the nearby Bhenti bugyal .
Those which are seen have also come here from the Devi Darshanath bugyal .
Beautiful work has been done on the wood in the village .
Live view of woodwork was done in old houses .
There is no electricity arrangement in the village right now .
Had lunch on the leaves of Dolu , which was a pleasant experience .
There were landslides at three places between ' Lakhi ' and ' Bhenti ' .
Acorn Rhododendron is the major vegetation there .
The forest area is good .
The Danu god of Lakhi and the Pandava temple of Bhenti is famous .
It is believed that the area of Danu begins from Lankhi .
The Jaat walked almost 31 k . . and reached Tharali .
It came to be known that this time also in ' Kulsari ' the Sri Yantra could not come out .
Due to the controversy in the Raj Jat of 1987 Sri Yantra had not been able to come out .
The administration and Kunwar Balwant Singh were staunch on not sacrificing and the priesthood did not agree to take out the underground Sri Yantra without giving sacrifice .
On the priests not taking out the Sri Yantra without sacrifice there was the threat of contretemps .
Now there will be a wait until the next Raj Jat .
The goddess will take a gift in Tharali village .
People were offering cucumber , parched rice , leaves of daffodils , cosmetic materials of the goddess , bangles , bindis , chareus , garlands , kohls , phoona , ribbon , sweets etc .
Gift - offering was happening .
The eyes of many became tearful .
There was a hustle-bustle like that of wedding .
Lunch was in Tharali village .
In the front on the other side the Rajajaat was going for the Chepadyun towards the Tharali market .
200 m . below Tharali at the confluence of Pindar and Pranmati is a Shiva temple and an ancient Narayan temple in the village .
Here are stone idols of Satyanarayana , Vishnu , Pandava , Parvati , Ganesha , Ramchandra , Devi , Hanuman and Nandi .
The priest is a Chandola brahmin .
Tharali is a village of 300 families .
Chantoli of Dewalgarh included from Tharali .
The palanquin came to the Tharali market from Tharali village .
A group of almost 5000 was hailing the goddess and giving offerings .
The youth were dancing at the tunes of songs and revelry , many ' elder amma ' and ' Boda ' were also dancing .
At evening 4 o'clock the palanquin reached ' Chepdyun ' .
Butola is the village of wholesalers .
Chantoli and Chausingya Medha coming from Nauti also stopped in Chepadyun .
But a meeting of the two did not happen .
Despite being in the same village the meet of Doli , Chantoil and Chausingya take place at the next stop in Nand Kesari .
There is a tradition from Chepadyun that the doli of Badhan Nanda ahead and Khadu and Chantoli comes from behind and the meet takes place next day in the Nandkesari Nanda temple .
The discharge of this tradition was also done in this Jaat , whose breach was done in the Raj Jaat of 1987 .
In which the the Dola of Nanda had run behind Rajachantoli .

From there we have to walk on the left bank of the Veera river .
There is easy ascending - descending from the valley to Gopeshwar .

1  4 miles north -LRB- towards the back -RRB- from the village near a small temple are three waterfalls .
Everybody drinks the water of that only .
Because of Chamoli square being near travellers stay less there .
The priest of the temple is a resident of that village .
The temple of Gopeshwar is standing in the middle of a big polo ground .
All around the polo ground are houses and dharamsalas and a stone floor is laid inside .

A new path of ascent has joined the Chamoli road before Gopeshwar and near the Haat chatti .
The travellers of Badrinath on going to southern Chamoli from Gopeshwar reach ' Haat chatti ' from the road of the northeast turn in Chamoli .
Rudranath from the Panch Kedar is only 12 miles away from Gopeshwar . but that is a difficult footpath .
Because of this reason only hill people go to Rudranath by that route .
There is a very small temple to the left side at 1  2 miles from Gopeshwar and to the right side a village on the bank of Balasoti river .
Alaknanda at one mile and at some distance on the right side the confluence of Alaknanda and Balasoti , at 1 1  2 miles on the right bank of the Alaknanda is a small village named Kotal and Chameli at two miles , which people also call Lal Sanga .

This small river has come from five - seven miles north from Gohna .
On the day of 6th September of 1893 a 400 yards high top of a mountain near the Gohna river fell in the Birhi river .
Because of its falling the flow of the river stopped .
By the side of Birhi till the other side a heap of dirt and stones almost 1 1  2 miles wide and 2 miles long has formed .
Because of the water stopping a big lake was formed and the water kept rising daily .
That lake was called by some as Birhi lake and by some as Gohana lake for being near Gohana village .
After pondering on the future condition of the fearsome lake the government made full arrangements of saving the life of people by sending engineers .
The bangalows of the engineers , telegram houses at places . feet high platforms on the sides of mountain at a distance of half miles to gaughe the height of the flood and wired from Gohna to Haridwar .
The ones giving the news were made to sit at places .
At the end of July the people staying below were lifted and settled on the high mountain .

Dead tired , boils on the feet and three members of the party found wandering and we pass the first quarter of the first night of the 19 nights of our expedition .
This is a small village school of Monpa tribal area of Western Arunachal .
Our name should also be published in the paper ' the head of the village gives a plea while seeing us off towards another village .
Even in these distant - intractable mountains the media love does not leave us alone .
Many times this beings us near to people who understand the inapproachability of this difficult campaign .
For this campaign the effect of systematic publicity reaches here too , on 30 January the seeing off by flag showing by the President , the program of Doordarshan on Bachendri in which a mortal like me was also shown speaking on ' women and mountaineering ' .
The journey from any part of North - Eastern Himalayas begins from the Saraighat Bridge built on the Brahmaputra in Guwahati .
Travellers with pure Mongolian faces going towards the Himalayas will proceed straight North from here .
My path is this itself .
As soon as the bus crossed the Saraighat bridge on leaving from Adabadi Adda of Guwahati the broken body of old dakan will be found by the Assam Trunk Road proceeding till ' Barhattachali ' .
Himalaya standing so close to Gondwanaland can be seen only in Assam .
The road going for Tejpur from Barhattachali breaks from here itself .
We reach ' Rangiya ' which is a big army cantonment of North - East .
On leaving Rangiya there are fields of wheat on both sides of the road .
Hidden in the middle of the bush of banana and bamboo is the Kachari - Bodo village .
Palm , tress of coconut , barns of betel .
Fishermen spreading out their nets in streams , Bodo children covered in mud gathering lap full of fishes .
Lowland begins from Tulsibadi .
Full with water .
The wheat will welcome the fragrance of the earth .

Tamilpur from Rangiya .
Then from Kumrikatta Bhabar starts .
Taxi driver Mohammad Syed Ali says - here I feel hot .
Initially the Khampa people of Bhutan all used to stay here .
Now since there is unrest there they do n't come here due to fear .
At a little distance in Bangajuli is the wide plains of the seasonal Kala river coming from Bhutan .
The dense forests of Bangajuli are filled with the famous trees Bonsa , Titakshya , Halock and Gamari of Assam .
Now the jungles have started thinning .
The fear of elephants has also started becoming less .
The ' Monka ' tea garden pours greenery and freshness on the flowing slope across the bridge of the Kali Nadi .
At its last part the border of Assam is kasba Daranga , which is called Bhutan fair market .
At 4 k . . from here the entrance door of Bhutan Samdrup Jonkar comes .
The path of exactly one hundred k . . from Guwahati to Bhutan passes through Kamrup , Nalbadi and Daranga districts .
On keeping foot in Bhutan by the majestic door made in the Buddhist style in Samdrup Jonkar the first basasat of Bhutan gives the feeling of entering some big monastery .
The doors of this Buddhist monastery could be opened in a formal way for the world only after 1974 .
For this reason Bhutan has been successful in evading the cultural - religious insurgency and societal - natural misery and entering the twenty - first century .
Bhutan is not only the medieval image of Himalayas but is also the lone heritage of the entire Tibetan cultural world being sacrificed in the flames of Chinese communism .
Bhutan is one of those rare parts of the world where man is gentle and easy like the earth and is soaked with earth intimacy .
The journey of such an earth is not just of geography - history and society - culture but more a journey of the internal world .
The commerce , business and transport of Eastern Bhutan in the decade of the sixties .
The formation of the Samdrup Jonkar happens by combining the Royal Bhutan Police , immigration office , Jokhang -LRB- district -RRB- office , school , hospital and bus terminus .
The market built by Marwaris and Bhutanese businessmen has not been able to get hold of the city .
Buddhist temple , prayer circle , colorful prayer flags and Bhutanese people wearing the national costume of Gho - Kira can win the heart of any traveller .
With the deluge of the four - five storied hotels the city is advancing fast .
With the increasing number of cars an arrangement of driving vehicles on one side in the main market has been started .
The old basasat of Bhutan Devthang is based at 19 k . . in a level saddle .
In 1826 when the Assamese came under the authority of the British , this door of Bhutan was also taken by the British under their authority on a condition of ten thousand rupees yearly pay .
In 1845 the Bhutanese made an appeal to increase this amount .
There was a war between both sides .
First the British army lost but in the second war happening on 22 November 1864 Bhutan lost .
25 of its soldiers were killed and 50 were wounded .
After the famous Centula treaty of 1865 the entire Himalayan quadrant state from the Dhansiri river on the border of Arunachal to Tista in the West came under the authority of the Britsh .
Devthang was snatched from Bhutan .
On 8 August 1949 in Darjeeling in the treaty between the Bhutan king Jigme Wangchuck and the Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru this Divangiri area of 32 square miles was again returned to Bhutan .
Whose name has been changed and kept Devthang .
A Hindu temple situated in the stony womb ahead from Narfang was built by the Indian Road Association , where primarily the cars of the Indian Army and Road Association stop .
From here is the climb .
After climbing 8,200 feet a road goes to Pemagalis from a crack made in Krishnagiri .
A hut on this crack will give the feeling of a man 's presence .
From here all around dense forests of Deodar , Spruce are seen .
Directly in the South is Yongla Gompa , in which a 258 year old Guru Dorjee Drole Lakhang -LRB- Buddhist temple -RRB- situated holds an important religious significance .
75 Gelong -LRB- Buddhist apprentice -RRB- along with Lama Nitin -LRB- the main lama of the district -RRB- of Pomagalis Rabde -LRB- the highest Lama association of the district -RRB- come and lodge here in summer .
Otherwise this canyon always remains in the grip of clouds .
On getting the sky clear the sight of the ice line will become like the great Himalayas visible from Kausani .
In medieval Bhutan there were four entrance doors joined with the four directions .
Khaling -LRB- Kha - mouth , Ling - village -RRB- was considered the door of the East .
Khaling ' based -LRB- 2250 metres -RRB- in the valley of Jurichu -LRB- river -RRB- is one of the most dense and oldest settlements .
The king Changul Pai of Khaling had bravely fought with Drupak ruler ' Chogel Minjur Tempa ' .
Old houses with roofs of bamboo and the flat fields captured inside fences of bamboo were the identification of the old Khaling .
The new Khaling has been made collaborating dazzling houses with tin roofs beside the road . market of fifteen - twenty shops , Junior high school , hospital , crippled school , handloom training center , animal clinic and some other government buildings .
After Khaling Gamchu is a big village .
Going ahead from here the limit of lower Himalayas has begun to get defined .
The central deprivation that divides the Lesser Himalayas and Greater Himalayas cuts the road four or five times before reaching the road .
On the left side on the slope below Ujrong is a big village , with which this descends into Dagmechu .
Versong is in the extended Himalayas .
Of the three major iron mines of Bhutan one was in Barsong with the help of which bridges were made in eastern Bhutan with chains of iron and relationships were formed in divided communities .
Before this also the river used to be crossed sitting on a basket of bamboo and with the support of a rope .
The centremost point of Bhutan is Yonphula .
The Indian Army has its base at Yonphula .
At a height of 2700 metre a 2 k . . long air strip is also made .
There is a long line of snowy mountains directly in the north and adjoined to the border of Arunachal in which is situated the supreme summit known by the name of Gandhi Topi .
The most dense valley of Dangmechu of Bhutan is seen from here .
Descending 8 k . . from Yanphula we reach Kanglung .
The only Sherubtse degree college of Bhutan is in Kanglung .
After its establishment in 1983 including the year 2000 Sherubtse has been able to produce total 1058 graduates .
By 2007 Sherubtse college will change into Ugyen Wangchuck university .
But it will take at least one decade now for Bhutan to gather its human resources .
There are 1,17,746 students in the schools of Bhutan .
Two thirds of 3026 students are Indian .
Even now the place of 650 teachers is empty .
Like this , there is vacancy at every level .
The graduates of Sherubtse will gradually fill up these vacancies .
Sherubtse is the brain of Bhutan .
The future of Bhutan is dependent on the spirit and sensibility of this place .
Here not only did I get a chance to carry out my teaching duties fruitfully but also be a part of the national development of Bhutan .
Kanglung has begun to feel like my second home .
The main city of old Bhutan ' Trashigang ' is situated at the confluence of Dangmechu and Gamrechu rivers 180 km away from Samdrup Jongkhar .
In 1667 along with the construction of Trashigang Jong by the third god king Chogyal Minjur Tempa the area came under the administration of western Bhutan .
This Jong of five storeys is the district headquarters of civil and religious administration .
On entering the Jong on the left side is the office of Jongda -LRB- Jongtrakila , Datramalik , which can now be placed equal to Jiladhish -RRB- .
In the whole of the rest of building are 75 lamas -LRB- Gilongs -RRB- and their district head Lama Nitin .
The prayer room of the idols of various postures of Lord Buddha and Guru Padmasambhav are made on every floor .
There are collections of religious texts from the eighth century till present , wall paintings and unique examples of Tibetan art here .
A little away from the main building is the temple of Matra Devi of Jong which protects the Jong from enemies .
In Bhutan the regional administration is conducted from Jong .
There are twenty Jong in all twenty districts where Jongda and Lama Nitin are handling the civil and religious administration .
Climbing down 6 k . . from Trashigong crossing the Chajam -LRB- iron bridge -RRB- built on Dangmechu a road goes to Trashiyangsi 45 k . . away from here .
We took the direction of Monger on crossing the river .
The ruins of the iron chained 400 year old bridge remain at Chajam .
Now the Indian Border Roads Organization has made iron bridges on every river .
After Chajam 2 k . . after Rolang the road comes in the lower Himalayas .
There is a monastery made by the descendent of Guru Padmalingpa Kunga Gyeltsen in Demchi 17 k . . climb from the main road .
Across from this is the valley of Serichu .
In Senegalese language the meaning of Seri is a special type of fragrance .
Seeing the medicinal herbs with fragrance and gold colored ' Serichu ' the memory of the Seri of my village shook me .
Crossing Seruchi the area of Bhuskhalan begins .
Near the settlement wherever the earth became naked , the restlessness of the Himalayas is seen .
Small units of purification of lemon grass oil near the road , only 10 kilowatt of hydro electricity units , pine trees , one or two houses and Seruchi valley wrapped in mist will be seen .
Yadi ' -LRB- 1415 feet -RRB- is a beautiful village of four storeys houses , near which is a dense jungle of pine and acorn .
A little away from Yadi after signs of dry lakes in a flat slope , fields of potatoes , school and Lakhang -LRB- Buddhist temple -RRB- Korila state is filled with Deodar , Spruce , Fir , Larch and Hemlock forests .
In the middle of these dense jungles after 14 k . . crossing Korila Pass is Kuri Chu valley .
From Kuri Chu valley Monger Jong looks like a golden bird .
A road taking a swift turn going through Tongsing , Yangpugang , Kilikhar villages reaches the headquarters of Monger district 91 k . . away from Trashigong .
This way cloth , grain , sugar , utensils and oil reaches Monger from Guwahati .
Vegetables and sweet tea is not available in the market for working Indians .
When Bhutanese people reach Monger from far-off villages with wild fruits , potatoes , beans and radishes , it becomes night .
Therefore , on lighting torches , market is set up in Mongar .
Now some tin sheds have been made in Mongar .
Perambulation has started increasing in the market .
In Mongar , there are five storey buildings on one side and shops of wood on the other side .
Mongar Jong is new , whose construction was got done by the third king of Bhutan Jigme Dorji Wangchuck .
There are ruins of an old Gap or mandal -LRB- officer of block level -RRB- .
There is an ancient trade route for going to Tibet from Lung tashi climbing down 10 k . . from Mongar .
Some portion of Trans Himalayas is very beautiful here .
Here is Singe Jong made of granite stones .
Guru Padmasambhava had meditated here near of this tiger shaped natural Jong .
On walking 15 k . . from Mongar .
There are horticultural , poultry and pig farms in the broad Bagad -LRB- 700 m . -RRB- of Limithang on crossing Kurichu .
The horse of Arabian breed gifted to the prince of Bhutan by former prime minister late Rajiv Gandhi has also been kept here .
There are relics of old Jongar Jong near Limithang .
Myth is rife that a young man from these ruins used to come visit a beautiful girl staying in the village nearby .
Later it was known that the young man was a cobra .
His offspring lives in these areas .
People have full faith on this myth .
Leaving the valley of Jimgon at 3 k . . from Limithang we proceed towards Yongkhu .
The fifty k . . road between Yongkhu till Sengor is filled with dangers .
Now apart from the horizon kissing jungles there is no other view on the ground .
We were in the southern slope of the famous Thrumshingla Wildlife Conservation point .
There are rain forests in Thrumshingla Wildlife Conservation .
25 k . . from Limithang is the village of the labourers of Namling Road .
There was more natural glow on the faces of the children living here than in the jungles .
This is the area of land subsidence and landslides .
The whole summit state was collapsing .
The forest was in the flow of the stemming Ganga by its own stomach .
Water all around , trees became crooked , the heap of granite rocks on the road as if they would tumble with a gust of wind .
The forest extensively wounded by its own beauty is beset with tectonic movements -LRB- because of the passing of the central faults -RRB- .
On such ground cramped road , sharp slopes on blind turns , afternoons getting blind because of not reaching on the earth are suitable for silencing the travellers .
The bus accident of June 1998 had happened here .
70 passengers died in the bus accident of June 1998 .
Reaching a height of Thrumshingla at 12,300 feet the experience is like that of climbing the back of an elephant .
From here in the North the border of Yumthang Jokhang begins .
Lantushi in the North - East , Jemgaon in the South and South - East and near Thrumsingala along with Monger districts the borders of four districts come and meet .
The rivers going East from here meet at Kurichu and the rivers going West at Yumthangchu .
The Royal Bengal Tiger has been sighted in Thrumsingla .
The first village in the midst of dense forests of fir , spruce , larch and deodar is ` Gejam ' -LRB- 3,280 metres -RRB- .
There are eight - ten houses of wood in Gejam village .
Two big bukharis remain busy in preparing the shuja -LRB- salty snacks , tea -RRB- , gomans and rice for the travellers going back and forth in the Gojam hotel .
To come out of Gejam is an experience like coming out of the mouth of some big tunnel .
The river which was born from Thrumsinghala and goes along till Gejam that suddenly gets lost in deep caves .
Leaving that , crossing a slight backbone - type mountain side we go down Ura valley .
Ura valley opens out in all directions .
It is as if the heights get a break .
Like veils fluttering in the breeze is the ' Ura ' village of animal tenders based on 3,000 metres between the mountains sleeping in the sky .
Intermediate rulers of Bhutan like Gayden Lama were born in Ura .
Even today this is the village of authors like Karma Ura .
The next camp was Kurjelkhang .
On entering Kurjelkhang bound within a hundred and eight chortens the first temple comes , which had been made by Sindhu king .
The old pine tree planted in this temple seems to have grown from the stick of the Guru .
Guru had sat here to meditate and on whichever stone the marks of his back were left , that has begun to be called Kurje .
Ugyen Wangchuck the first king of Bhutan , when he was the Trongsa Penlap -LRB- Governor -RRB- , had got made the big idol and temple of Guru .
Now the third largest temple has been made .
In the compound of this temple group the tombs of all three late kings of Bhutan is there .
Bumthang remained the capital of Bhutan till 1952 .
The birth of the first king of Bhutan Ugyen Wangchuck also happened in Bumthang .
The Wangdicholing -LRB- Palace -RRB- made in Jakar is the birth place of the first king .
The other major attraction of Bumthang is Jakar Jong .
It is believed that when Lama - Nage - Wangchuck wanted to get the construction of a castle done near the confluence of the Chokhochu and Tangchu then he had found a white bird sitting near the present Jakar Jong .
Probably it is possible that this could be the stork which comes on migration from Tibet in the winter .
The meaning of ' Ja ' is big - wide and the meaning of ' kar ' is white .
The ' Jong ' was known by the name made by these two words and its foundation - stone was laid at that place .
In 1646 Chogel Minjur Timpa expanded the Jong .
In 1676 Devraja Gese Tenzing Rabge got the construction of this Jong completed .
The intermediate Minar of this Jong is 50 feet high .
Bumthang ' has remained a follower of the Buddhist religion .
Guru Pema Lingpa -LRB- 1450 - 1521 B . . -RRB- believed to be the reincarnation of Padmasambhav was born in the ironsmith family of Lunglachel village of Chokhor .
He had established Tamsing Lakhang believed to be the center of Nigampa community a current of Tantric Buddhist religion .
Coming down from Jakar Jong we came to Wangchungling village .
The fields filled with potatoes and mustard were decorated with hives of bees .
Lines of school children were on both sides of the road .
I threw a sad glance towards the forests collapsing from the valley .
To escape the threat of cold climate the forests were being taken care of very well .
It was possible only then to enjoy the happiness of Bumthang Bukhari .
The market of Bumthang is very clean and open .
The next camp of the journey was at 440 k . . from Trashigang .
Now we had to cover a journey of 282 k . . from here to Thimpu .
Who has seen the entire Bumthang anyway .
Seeing Bumthang valley means having seen its four valleys in which are conglomerated Uma , Tang , Chokhor and Chume .
We reached Chume valley based at 2,600 metres from Bumthang .
The wool business of Chume valley is famous .
The shops decorated with colorful clothes of Yata -LRB- Una -RRB- of Jugne village in Chume and active women on Bhutanese traditional handloom captured the heart .
Pralkhang near Jugne and Tharpling cave made on the right mountain give a feel of the religious prosperity of the 14th century .
The continuation of houses with orchards of apples and roofs of wood is found till Jasta village .
Himani valley begins ahead and we get lost in seas of fir , birch , spruce and deodar .
Let the Sonmarg Baltal valley of Kashmir be made wider and .
Yontongla rising gradually from the wide , beautiful , plain Himani valley seemed sleeping like a python .
The area of Himani valleys of 100 k . . from Trumsingala to Yontongla is ordinarily 2,976 metres high .
All around it are mountains 14 to 16 thousand feet high .
Monsoon also gets weak in Bumthang based between these two valleys .
In comparison to Mongar and Trashigang of old Bhutan there is enough humidity here .
My daughter Aditi had gained success in recognizing eleven species of Buransh between these two cracks and I had thought as if the connection with the ground was lost .
Opposite to the Western Himalayas split in small and sharp valleys here are Himalayas of aerial fields and wide brow .
The slope of the other side of Yongtongla -LRB- 3,200 metres -RRB- .
The Gonpa or Gumpa built in high places in Bhutan are the meditation places of the Lamas .
Some families have also begun settling near Gonpa .
The wintery basasatas based in the valleys are known by the name of ' Pam ' in Gonpa .
There is movement of seasonal immigration between Pam and Gumpa .
Near Dorsang the old prayer place has been changed to fields .
From here the highest summit Gankar , Punsu is sighted .
Bhutanese call the 7,561 metre high Gankar mountain ' Bhrata ' with spiritual sentiment .
Mangdenchu coming from the root of Gankar divides Bhutan in two parts .
Without crossing the Mangdechu one can not go across Bhutan .
Therefore this valley is important both from the strategic and political viewpoint .
Trongsa Jong seen from a view point made 12 k . . before reaching Trongsa and from the horror of the black mountain standing in its background the traveller as if trembles .
The first two kings of Bhutan had ruled from Trongsa itself .
The greatest ' Trongsa ' Jong of Bhutan is this .
On reaching Trongsa we got relief .
244 k . . road goes from Trongsa till Gelfu based at the foothills of Middle Bhutan .
cmlplt it .
In 1648 with the purpose of liberating Bhutan from internal calamities however many forts made in present Bhutan in them Trongsa Jong is also included .
It is believed that in the times of Nagiwandchuk -LRB- 1517 - 1554 A . . -RRB- the construction of a big Chorten was got done here .
This Jong made on a cliff standing over the Trongsa river got completed in many phases .
Trongsa situated at 2 . 060 metres seems like a common Himalayan settlements .
Taking a round of 15 k . . the road again comes close to Trongsa Jong from across Mangde Chhu again .
After seeing Sarchop or eastern Bhutan in the east from Thrumsingala , Jupcho or middle Bhutan between Thrumsingala and Pelela we are advancing towards Jangcho or western Bhutan .
From Rubakji to Novding across Pelela not only is extraordinary natural beauty spread instead it was a unique experience to see the various borders of ascending and descending vegetation covered in the heights .
We were climbing with the support of Nikachu coming out from Morothong and meeting in Chendbaji in that direction .
Now we will have to descend with Dangchu merging in Sankosh the large river of Western Bhutan .
Near about Khelekha and Garjikha village we met ' Dangchu ' .
While passing through Chodojha near Lantenjanga crossing this Wangdi valley opens .
Wangdi -LRB- 1,380 metres -RRB- situated between the forests of scattered pines and mountains in the distance is the only such valley of Bhutan , which is identical to many valleys of Kumaon .
Seeing the houses with roofs of slate reminded me of Kumaon .
Chiring the stewardess of hotel Orchard said that workers making carvings on stone and Jong -LRB- forts -RRB- stay in Riching gong situated nearby .
cmplt it .
Trosing in the East , Chirang and Dagna in the South , Punakha in the North and Thimpu , Paro and Ha Jongkhal fall in the West .
In the big prayer room of Wangdi Phodrang the stories relating to the previous birth of Padmasambhava and Buddha are drawn .
The importance of Wandgi Phodrang Jong also increased due to its proximity to Punakha .
Punakha remained the winter capital of Bhutan till 1955 .
Even today the Central Lama Association of Bhutan travels to Punakha in winters .
By the time of crossing ' Mochu ' which flows in the root of Wangdi Phodrang night has fallen .
White sand shining at the bank of Mochu and in between the setting celestial redness the beauty of the Wangdi Fodrung Jong is to be seen to be believed .
The approximately 300 year old bridge built on Mochu had been swept away by the flood of 1968 .
Now a new iron bridge has been built here .
The new Wandgi Phodrang city is settling by the support of Mochu .
Although the old Wangdi city is also clean and open .
At some distance in Lobasa the natural resources center began in 1992 .
A road from Lobasa goes to Talo .
Thimpu is now only 68 k . .
There was no opportunity of going to Talo .
In Talo the reincarnation of the spiritual teacher Sabdrung Navang Nagmel of Bhutan has been taking birth .
In November 1995 a two feet 3 inches high golden idol of Sabdrung Jigme Dorjee has been established in Machelkhang of Talo .
In Mache -LRB- remains -RRB- Lakhang many old remains of Sabdrung have been kept safe .
The body of Sabdrung is protected in Punakha Jong itself .
We reached ' Dorchula ' at ten ' o clock at night .
Dorchula is the dividing line of Thimpu and Punakha valleys .
In Dorchula there is an old chorten and a prayer pole .
The road goes down towards Thimpu .
The bright light of Ghantaghar has given the feeling of reaching Thimpu .
Shimmering Thimpu is the image of the present of Bhutan .
From the main market Norjim of Thimpu towards Chorten Lama -LRB- road -RRB- on walking just a few steps on the left is hotel 89 .
Today is 20th April of 1999 .
In the forest of blue pine on the western mountains of Thimpu the golden rays of the sunrise have reached .
Thimpu has awakened .
Gradually children dressed in pink banded and blue colored Gho - Kira -LRB- the gradual national costume of men and women -RRB- have begun to be seen on the road .
I reach at Norjen corner .
There is an abundant number of vehicles in the city .
Both sides lined shops , houses are made in the traditional style of Bhutan .
Houses with flat roofs of concrete have started breaking this grandeur .
There are Indian items at shops but the cars running on the roads are Japanese .
Now the Maruti car has also finished this competition .
Thimpu is a city budding with the produce of the power of its increasing external contacts and its past .
Along with the capital Thimpu is also a city of hope for the future .
Thimpu is a center of beliefs and faith .
Thimpu is the dearest city of every Bhutanese .
The house of their king is in Thimpu .
Thimpu also loves every Bhutanese equally .
This quality will be less in other cities .
In the first meeting that happened with Thimpu this had started feeling like my own .
We saw Thimpu city on coming to the Bhutan Radio Broadcast Centre attached to Motithang .
This city is based by the support of Thimpu chu in the North South direction in the middle of Docin Choling to Simtokha .
Limes of snow were still remaining in the mountains of Dorchula there .
Thimpu valley is approximately 15 k . . long and 5 k . . wide taking a height of 2,350 metres from sea level makes a shape of a drawn bow with Thimpu chu -LRB- river -RRB- .
The center of this valley is Tashi Chojong -LRB- of Jong of a great religion -RRB- .
In 1641 while changing an ancient cave to a Jong Sabdrung Navang had given this name .
Although in 1216 B . .
In 1694 the third deshi -LRB- king -RRB- of Bhutan got the expansion of this done .
Here in 1730 the religious rupture continuing between Tibet and Bhutan was ended by signing on the treaty .
Subject to this treaty the Bhutanese delegate kept being sent to Lhasa .
In principle the Dongon gumpha was not in the valley but a little higher up , where now the central gumpha school of Bhutan runs .
The 13th Devraj of Bhutan Serab Wangchuk had got the construction of this done at the place of the present Jong made in the valley in 1775 .
Damages had been caused to this Jong in the fire of 1771 and 1869 .
In 1870 the father of the first king of Bhutan Jigme Namgel had got the renovation of this Jong done and the construction of a temple done .
After 10 days we left for ' Paro ' .
We descended 21 k . . by the support of Thimpu chu .
Parochu ' beside Kinsilsila mixes in the Thimpu chu .
From here we recognized the road going towards Paro .
Paro is 52 k . . from Thimpu .
The lower valley of Paro is Sankri and Shushk .
At Sunjajom on crossing Paro chu we move ahead from the left bank Paro remains 15 k . . from here and the valley starts opening .
We headed straight towards the Paro air strip .
The only aircraft of Bhutan B . . . 146 - 100 has left on the flight for Bangkok .
I remembered the European Father Jovo Cabrel and Istebhavo Casilla who entered Bhutan on 25th March 1627 .
On reaching Paro both these travellers were made imprisoned by a Bhutanese traveling with them in his house .
Somehow on escaping from his grasp these two had met Sabdung Navang Namgel the propagandist of Spanish religion .
To live with these monks three lamas had been given relaxation .
Some local people came to see the idols of Jesus and Mary and to tell their sorrows .
But on not seeing any interest developing towards Christianity these two monks had gone to Western Tibet after staying in Paro till 8 months .
In Bhutan then there was refusal to any outside person coming barring saints and hermits .
Bhutanese historians write that once when the uncle of the king of Cooch Behar reached Paro in the eagerness of seeing Bhutan he had also been imprisoned here .
The alliance of Bhutan with the rest of the world was subsisted only after the Indo - China war .
The development work began in Bhutan with Indian help .
In 1962 the first school opened in ' Paro ' .
In 1968 electricity came , roads were built and now an air strip is also made here .
The nearby villages still have houses with roof of wood and walls of mud .
Wealthy families have started putting roofs of steel .
We reached Paro market directly .
The Dungse chorten Lakhang built here is unparalleled in the whole of Bhutan .
Paro market of clean and wide roads has been settled in a systematic manner .
The crowd of villagers buying Yak meat and the shops of video cassettes together presented a new - old Paro .
On going a little ahead only is the temple of Yongthang Gyalpo .
All the iron - chain bridges built in the 16th century in Bhutan is the contribution of this Lama engineer .
Now we reached Tajong by taking a long circular route .
From this Tajong of five storied cyclorama at some time royal soldiers must be guarding the main Jong .
The district headquarters is still in the main Jong .
But the only museum of Bhutan is now situated in Tajong .
We saw Paro valley from Tajong .
The crop of Jowar in the valley is prospering .
Apples have swollen on the slopes .
Descending from Paro market we proceeded towards Drugyel Jong 18 k . . away from here .
The entire valley gets divided in exactly two parts by Paro market .
There are fields of wheat and pine below Paro market .
The upper valley is covered with spruce , birch , Hemlock and blue pine forests .
In the upper valley only is the biggest Buddhist pilgrimage Takchang cave of Bhutan .
Any traveller returning from Bhutan is filled up with nature consciousness .
Such vibrant and complete nature will be found only in some areas .
Bhutan reared in the shadow of Lamas like Gurupadmasambhava , Pemalingpa , Sabdrung , Navang Namgale and Tenzing and their reincarnations is completely a religious place .
The second big happiness of this journey is also seeing the new , just created - budding and taking the speed of development society .
We have not relished the happiness of creation in India .
The Lama Gurus coming from Tibet have strengthened the religious cornerstone of Bhutan so not only did the foundation of economy go from India to Butan on the other hand Indian Buddhist religion taught Bhutan the first lesson in civilization and culture .
Bhutan is running towards the west with great speed .
In this race it is difficult to maintain the identity of Bhutan .
I had to go straight in the direction of North till Mansarovar .
Now this decision had to be taken that how to reach there .
I only had the support of a compass .
I had to go forward from ' Atkal ' itself .
Stopping walking north - east I hoisted the package on my back and started descending .
Till now the side of the mountain that I was walking on , the heat of the Sun was more on that side , the snow was also not more than 5 -6 inches but now I had to walk on the other side .
There the heat of the Sun used to reach very less .
So my feet used to sink till 14 - 15 inches in the snow at some places .
In some places the snow was only 7 -8 inches because of which I started feeling increasing tiredness .
I had the support of a stick .
At places my feet used to get stuck in stones of ice and extraction used to become difficult .
My Tibetan shoes tore completely .
Blood began flowing from the cuts from the legs .
My load was not heavy , but now it seemed that strenuous .
Like this found a three mile straight road .
On going five miles ahead I found two lakes .
These were made by the melting of snow .
The circumference of one was almost five miles and of the other was 2 miles .
Colourful ducks were swimming in it .
The number of ducks was so much that the water of the lake was also not visible .
Seeing the view there I got so enchanted that I forgot the pains of my body completely .
I kept the name of the big lake as Ikai and of the smaller one Jinko .
On looking at the compass I realized that for going North - East I had to cross the river .
But this was not pleasant as the previous experience was still fresh .
The time when I was thinking this at that time I saw a man crossing the river .
On asking it was known that he was going from Kham to Gilang Ringponch for a visit .
I explained to him that I am getting very weak give me help in crossing the river .
Saying this I gave him a lot of eatables .
He became very happy with my generosity and he picked up my things on his back , and holding my hand began walking forward .
After helping me cross the river he told me the road ahead and again crossing the river he went away .
I also took my route .
On walking fourteen miles we found the Kyangchu river .
At a distance of fifty miles from here a mountain covered with snow can be seen .
This comes out from this mountain only .
Its span is maximum 450 yards and minimum 60 yards .
Before descending we had our supper .
That time I was a guest of the Ladakh merchant .
His servants collected dry dung etc , prepared food and I would read religious texts .
While leaving Alchu Lama had given me a little rice .
Here the rice comes from Nepal and is available very expensive .
I had eaten rice after a very long time so it felt very tasty .
I had reached the bank of the river by 9 o ' clock .
The ice on the bank was frozen as it is .
I waited till the melting of the snow and began making arrangements for lunch .
I had wished this that the load of the goats be left on their backs and to release them across the river .
But this could not happen as the river was deep .
In the end I removed the load and took them with the help of a rope .
The depth of the water was a lot so even on gathering my clothes properly they got wet .
The goats would have swam but without the rope they would definitely have been swept away by the force of the water .
We crossed easily .
On getting to the other bank I tied the goats to a tree .
I took off all my clothes and putting them out to dry went naked to the other shore for getting things .
Getting there I applied oil to the body for a second time and made such a bundle of all my things which I could lift on my head .
Keeping the bundle on my head I entered the river for the third time .

World ' s beautiful destinations and objects lure him a lot .
Fulfilling his hobby of wandering wherever Tradescent went he would surely bring some or the other unique thing and he went on collecting such unique things in his house for years .
This eccentricity got over him in such a way that he started putting up exhibition of his many unique things in his home only .
His son also adopted this habit of father Tradescent .
He also started collecting things from world over and no place was left in his house to keep these precious things .
Tradescent met politician Elias Ashmol who had helped The British kingdom during the civil war of Britain and proposed to give his precious objects the form of a museum .
Ashmol himself kept such a hobby and in his personal collection many rare objects were present .
Tradescent ' s desire was that his collection should reach such a place where it is seen by maximum number of people .
Ashmol liked his proposal and in 1667 the museum started in a formal way .
In 1683 this museum was opened for common citizens .
In the initial stage of this museum however it was started through the personal collection of Tradescent , his son and Ashmol but later office bearers of The East India Company also contributed their gifts to this museum .

Towards the back of this palace are some toilet rooms for royal use .
It seems from this machine process that some sort of air conditioning arrangement was here and its use was mainly as summer palace .
As per what foreign travellers have written secret work was done here .
This Hammam is counted among Mughals ' best Hammams .
On its roof are three deep ponds .
They were filled with river water through the Persian wheel .
These Persian wheels used to run near Khizri or watergates .
The water from the ponds on roofs is taken to Nageena Mosque , Machhi - Bhavan , fountains of Sheeshmahal and Musamman Burj , waterfalls and ponds .
It is visible that during Mughal period the water of Yamuna was completely clean , pure and worth drinking .
Emperor Shahjahan also used to drink the same water .
After the Somgarh battle Aurangzeb encircled the fort and ceased the supply of water from this river due to which the emperor surrendered on 8 June 1685 .
After this for the protection of the fort Aurangzeb got expansive ' Gadhgaj ' made in front of the fort doors .
Jahangir ' s chain of justice -LRB- Zanjeer . - Adal -RRB- -LRB- 1605 -RRB- : It is that place where Mughal emperor Jahangir established the chain in 1605 .
He has written in his autobiography that after royal ordination the first order he gave was this that The chain of justice should be put up , with which if the people involved in the administration of law cause delay or evil then the victim coming here can shake this chain for getting justice so that my attention garnered by its sound .
This chain was made of pure gold .
Its length was 30 yards -LRB- 80 feet -RRB- and there were 60 bells on it .
Its weight was 4 mana -LRB- 1 quintal -RRB- , one end of it was tied to the dome of Shah - But located close to it and the other was tied to a stone pillar at the river bank .
This chain was not a mere imagined tale .
Contemporary foreign travellers like William Hawkins had seen it themselves .
It has also been illustrated in a contemporary painting made in 1620 .
This was a unique experiment for abatement of people ' s troubles .
Without any fee , fear and formality the public could reach the Emperor directly -LRB- who was supreme in the judicial system -RRB- and could get immediate justice .
In this Judiciary no discrimination of caste or religion , nor a difference between rich and poor - this is no doubt a dream for modern jurists but a lesson as well .
This marvellous arrangement for justice of Jahangir , that is , Adal . - Jahangir became an example in Indian history .
Gazani gate -LRB- 1030 - 50 -RRB- : originally this was placed in the tomb of Mahmud Ghaznavi situated in Ghazni .
Mahmud Ghaznavi died in 1030 A . . in 1842 the British uprooted and brought it here .
In the historical declaration of Lord Alenbro it was said that this was that this is the very sandalwood door which was stolen Mehmood in 1025 from Somnath and this way the British have avenged the 800 year old insult .
This lie was wrought to gain sympathy of the common people of India .
In reality this gate is Gazni ' s local Deodar wood and not sandalwood .
Its design is entirely different from the ancient wood art of Gujarat .
An inscription is also engraved in its upper part in which there is a clear description of Mahmud along with laudatory attributes .
Sir John Marshal had installed a notice board of this intent along with description of this event and the gate .
This gate is 16 . feet high and 13 . feet wide .
Its weight is around half a ton .
In the end the thought to fix this door again in Somnath was abandoned and it stayed there in the room .
It has no relation to Mughals or their fort it has been left behind either in the form of victory symbol of British campaign or in the form of special memory of the historical lie of East India company .
This beautiful palace is made on the highest garret of the fort of main Agra towards east towards the river .
Emperor Akbar basically got it made of red stone for oriel window sight .
After sunrise everyday Akbar would also pray sun from there only .
Jahangir also used it as an orial window , this has exhibited clearly in its painting made in the year 1620 A . .
He also put up his ' Adal . - Zanjeer ' at its south only .
Because it is an ashtastra it is called as Mussaman burj .
Its mention in Parisian history records and foreign traveller descriptions has been by the names of Shah - Burj , Shahi - Burj or Baadshahi Burj also and to call it Jasmine tower or Summan Burj would de unethical and wrong .
The way contemporary historian Lahori has written Shahjahan renovated it with marble in the middle of 1632 - 40 .
He also used it for orial window view .
It is visible that like court this was also a semi important mughal institution .
It is an octagonal building whose 5 outer arms are extended towards the river in the form of verandah .
Every arm is opened through pillars and sides .
The arm of the east is extending more towards the front and the royal oriel window is made on it only .
Towards the western side of this palace is an expansive verandah in which Shah nashi are made .
A reservoir is made in its floor .
Decoration is done through Mosaic in it .
Beyond this veranda is a courtyard in the north of which is a netted terrace .
In west there are gradual rooms till Sheeshmahal and in south is a cabin and a pillared courtyard .
This way it is a huge family which is completely made of white marble .
There are deep inscriptions engraved on the walls so that the walls do not look empty or desolate .
On the margins of verandas designer vines have been joined through mosaic and their middle natural old people are etched through carving .
This was directly associated with Diwaan . - khaas , Sheesh mahal , Khaas Mahal and other palaces from here only Mughal emperor used to run the administration of the entire nation .
From this burj complete scene of Tajmahal is seen and Shahjahan spent 8 years of his imprisoned life here only and here only he died .
His body was taken to Taj Mahal by boat and burried there .
I feel immense happiness in keeping my views on Jaigarh fort that has been a lifeline for Kachhawa rulers .
The Kachhawa rulers of Jaipur and Ajmer understood the importance of a fort and they got 50 such forts constructed of which Jaigarh fort is the pre - eminent .
Pre - eminent in Medieval forts , Fort of Jaigarh is situated on a plateau above Amber palace near Jaipur in Rajasthan .

An effort to search the treasure supposedly hidden here was made in 1975 by the Indian government .
This search was done on the basis of an invoice found at the places of two families of Jaipur state .
In this search nothing came in hands of the government , but the fort got immense publicity .
As per the wish of his late father Maharaja Maansingh II we took the unprecedented decisions of opening this fort for the public .
In 1982 a trust was established for its maintenance and in 1983 the fort was opened for public .
Maintaining the old form of the fort some facilities were provided in it for sojourners and tourists .
In the next two decades of Jaigarh fort museum arsenal gallery were developed .

Along with spring has begun some unknown unique halts of tourists and one of them is the journey from Jammu to Udhampur .
Although this 53 kms journey began two years back but due to no awareness majority of tourists return back form the dominion without experiencing its pleasure .
Made at a cost of 550 crores one end of this track touch the plains of Jammu while the other enters the .
Tunnels and high bridges on the entire way are the speciality of this journey .
The track has to go through not 1 or 2 but 20 tunnels of all sizes .
After taking out passengers from the boring atmosphere of the station the first tunnel of the journey lets them see ' Har ki Paudi ' .
This scenes continues till the time the train has not entered the second tunnel .
As soon as the train leaves the darkness of the tunnel behind , Jammu and Kashmir ' s lifeline tavi becomes visible from the windows on both the sides .
Journey ' s first , seventh and fifteenth tunnels can be said as the longest .
These tunnels 2 . kms long are longer than the Khaas Jawahar tunnel present on the Jammu - Srinagar highway .
158 bridges made in this inaccessible area tells the tale of the dexterity of the engineering of Indian Army , in the lack of which it would have been impossible for the trains to reach here .
The one worth mentioning of them is the ' Gambhir bridge ' , whose height is 77 metres .

At the time when we got down at Sydney airport then it was 6 in the morning .
I felt the same way as the way the feeling of warmth can be comfortable for any person coming from Delhi in the second week of December .
Direct from airport we reached the hotel already decided for ourselves .
We had to stay at the Four Season hotel here .
From the building of this hotel of a total of 32 floors , the bird 's eye view of the entire city is seen .
After freshening up and also taking breakfast from there we reached Playfair café for lunch and after taking luch around 2 ' o clock set out to roam around the city .
The first thing of the city that effected us was the cleanliness and wealth .
These are those points of Australia that bedazzles every Indian .
We were first taken to the Opera house .
It is a live example of Sydney ' s beauty .
This fine arts center of all galleries is also the first attraction of the tourists coming here .
The thought of its construction was made in the 40 ' s of the last decade , but it could be in its physical form in the next decade .

A tragic chapter has been associated with this temple .

Devsthan department has begun its drill .
Under the plan after training the Temple guide they will be given information important from the point of view of tourism , history of temples , specialities and importance .
Such people will get priority in it who are associated with temples and who take an interest towards temples .
There are more than 600 temples under Devsthan , of which around 100 temples are such , which have importance for tourists as well .
Of them mainly Tripura Sundri of Baanswada , Deshnok of Bikaner , Bhandashah Jain temple , Govind Devji , Khaatu Shyamji of Seekar , Saalasar Dham , Gogamedi of Hanumangadh , Tanotmata temple of Jaisalmer , Ekling ji of Udaipur , Shrinath ji , Jain temple of Ranakpur , Dilwada jain temples of Mount Abu are main .
In majority of places the responsibility of temple 's information stays with the related priest .
Temple guide will be specially given training in many languages along with English .
If priests become involved in it then definitely there will be an increase in their income .
Moreover people being associated with this plan will get employment as well .
There are massive possibilities in ' temple tourism ' .
Looking at this , an effort to begin temple guide plan will be made soon .
With this the right information of the state 's religious heritage will be able to reach .
The credit for making the first Hindu temple in America goes to the Vedanta Samaj .
Vedanta Samaj laid the foundation of a temple in San Francisco city in 1906 .
After this temples were made in Hollywood in 1938 and Santa Barbara in 1956 .
These temples were built on the basis of the image of Hinduism which Vivekananda presented in his speeches , in the center of which were Hindu religious texts and the entire effort was put to understand it 's essence .
Keeping idol worship in mind the construction of temples started at that time in 1970 when Indian Hindus started immigrating to America in huge numbers .
It 's main reason was that in 1965 the restrictions imposed on Asian migrants immigrating to America were relaxed .
Temples made in America in near about 1970 can be divided in two divisions .
In the first division are Iskcon temples which were made for a special group .
Such temples come under the second division which were made for Hindus and whose motive was to bring together Hindus from various cultures .
This is why they developed various procedures to worship .
A . . Bhaktivedant Swami Prabhupad -LRB- 1896 - 1977 -RRB- , founder of Iskcon came to New York in 1965 .
Within one year he established an ashram at 26 Second Avenue wherein he used to give sermons on Geeta on Monday , Wednesday and Friday .
During sermons he used to tell young Americans about the preachings of Saint Chaitanya .
In his view the tradition of Teacher - student and worshipping in temples had a lot of importance .
Isckon built temples in American cities .
Of them the most grand temple is the ' Palace of Gold ' situated in New Vrindavan of West Virginia .
There is an Isckon temple in the northern central New Jersey , at Jacksonville road .
This temple is situated at the peak of a mountain .
According to the followers of Isckon , since twenty years Isckon has its property on this temple .
On all its four sides is a beautiful garden which is taken care of by the followers .
The temple has a total land of 2 . acres .
According to the American law religious places with more than 5 acre land have to pay tax .
Many followers also stay here and at special occasions followers from nearby areas gather here .
Followers continuously inspire new people to follow the devotion path as per Isckon .
There is enough place in the temple for worshipping .
Idols are placed in front of the entry gate .
These idols of traditional style are made to worn .
All idols are of various forms of Sri Krishna and are dedicated to the worship of Krishna .
Here besides historical people like Shri Krishna Chaitanya and Shree Niyananda idols of Jagannath , Baldeva , and Subhadra are also there .
The temple remains open on all seven days of the week but Sunday is an important day and on that day two to three hundred people gather .
Maximum followers are north Indians but some European - American are also included in them who will be seen in Indian attire .
Programs start at 5 in the evening in which Hare Krishna mantra chant , singing of devotion songs and hymns , and idol worship are included .
After that spiritual talk and prasad distribution takes place .
After prasad community meal is also organised and the task of making of food is done by the followers only .
A speaker is also called on this occasion who gives a sermon on spirituality and presents the community with leadership .
Speakers are the members of the managing committee .
There are 12 members in the committee chosen by Prabhupad .
Members of the committee only present leadership to the Isckon temples situated in various areas of America .
The traditional temples of India are not run like the Isckon temples .
In traditional temples devotees in huge numbers gather in the worship rituals that take place daily .
In 1977 in America 2 such temples were devoted to the devotees .
Of them one temple is Maha Vallabh Ganpati Devsthanam in the Flushing area of New York which is popular as Ganesh Temple .
The second is the Shri Venkateshwar temple situated in the Pittsburgh area of Pennsylvania but contrary to temples in India in American temples an effort to produce communal harmony among Hindus is made .
The famous Hindu temple of Chicago is remembered for Vivekananda 's speech .
In New Jersey Venkatesh temple is very popular among the Hindus which is known as Balaji Temple .
In the 80 's in America initially normal houses made of brick and cement were given the form of a temple .
Worship rituals and cultural programs were organised in them .
Towards the end of the decade the course of making grand temples on the hill tops began .
Religious organizations started to collect charity from the devotees for the construction of temples during the 90 's .
The course is still on .
Many temples have been constructed in the suburbs of New Jersey .
In the South Brunswick area of New Jersey construction of a grand Durga temple has been done .
In Rajasthan , 80 k . ms away from Jaipur is situated Shree Kalyanji temple in the Degree town of Tonk district .
It is also known by the names of ' Shree Ji ' and ' Diggi Kalyanji ' .
According to the belief the idol of Shri Kalyanji was enshrined by king Digva .
Construction of the present temple was done under the reign of Rana Sangramsingh in the year 1527 .
It is noteworthy that although the idol enshrined in the temple is of Lord Vishnu but several forms of the lord are visible to the devotees in it .
Everyday there is a crowd of devotees and on every full moon night and ekadashi a huge fair is held .
Three big fairs are held in a year on Vaishakh Poornima , Shravan month 's amavasya , and Ekadashi of Bhadrapad .
It is believed that this abode of Lord Kalyanji and his attractive idol , like a Kalpavriksha in Kalyug , is the fulfiller of human wishes and remover of all their problems .
Especially for patients and lepers -LRB- people suffering from leprosy -RRB- is believed to be an incarnate Sankatmochan .
Why Sankatmochan for lepers ?
Why is it 's mystery contained in the story of their origin ?
In brief the story is that once Devraj Indra expelled Urvashi from heaven .
She started living on Chandragiri hill near the capital of king Digva on earth .
The king was attracted towards her and had to wage a war against Indra to procure her .
King Digva lost .
Urvashi cursed the king to suffer from leprosy .
Lord Vishnu gave a solution on the King getting perturbed that after some time my idol will come flowing in sea , and you will recover from leprosy by paying obeisance to it and by drinking foot ambrosia .
The king recovered from the disease .
The place at which the king fought a battle with Indra , there established a Kalyanmayi idol of Lord Vishnu .
Since then till today this idol is famous as Kalyaanji .
This festival celebrated in the ITF ground of the capital Portblair of Andaman - Nicobar island group , is the main festival of this island group , which the tourists coming here make even more fun filled .
It is such a golden opportunity for Indian and foreign tourists as they get an opportunity to know about the lifestyle of the tribes staying at various islands over here .

It is an ideal destination for camel safari , jeep safari , and desert trekking .
There is a story about the only hilly area of Rajasthan ' Mount Abu ' that it 's name was kept on the name of a snake named ' Aburd ' .
It 's temperature stays less summers for sure , during winters also it 's beauty is worth seeing .
Such an attraction which not only draw Indians but foreign tourists also towards itself .
The festivals organised here and the people here who dance on the tunes of music make t he atmosphere more colorful .
Fanfare of folk dance and folk music is also there besides cultural programs in this program which is run for three days organised by Rajasthan Tourism department .

Dilwada 's temples made of marble of Jain tirthankars are the best examples of architecture which attract tourists towards itself .
Mount Abu is connected to the Abu road station of Delhi - Ahmadabad rail track , wherefrom buses and taxis are available every time .
As compared to the international tourism , Indian tourism did not have to bear much loss .
Discount and increasing facilities have made the middle class the king of market .
It may be domestic or international tourism , tourists made full use of low costs .
Due to terrorist attacks , recession , and swine flu there was a decrease in the number of foreign tourists but the effect on domestic tourism was less .
Especially on pilgrimages there was no effect of terrorist attacks and swine flu .
Where 25 to 30 percent of decrease in tourist activities was registered in Europe and America , in India this percentage was only around 10 - 12 .
In the initial months of the year it was more .
With the beginning of holiday season a positive mood began to develop in tourism industry .
Tourism department and tour operators lured tourists by giving discounts and attractive packages .
On one side where there a pessimistic atmosphere due to the deficiency that came in advance booking . last moment booking . gave relief to the tourism department .
By the middle of the year life began to return to the tourism world .
Ti invite foreign tourists , with the support of hotels , airlines , and other segments year 2009 was declared as ' Visit India Year - 2009 ' , but tourist industry could not reap it 's enough benefits .
In the month of November this year 5 . 18 Lakh foreign tourists came , which is . percent less than the tourists who came in November last year .
The number of tourists coming to India from January to November was 45 . 41 lakh , whereas there was hope that more than sixty lakh foreign tourists will come in 2009 .
But despite all this till November in the income of foreign income a five percent of increase has been registered as compared to last year .
Through international tourism income of Rs . 4635 was earned till November in 2008 and this year till November this number reached to 5523 crores .
With the aim of controlling their budget corporate sector put a halt on the travels and meetings and conferences being held in foreign countries whose direct impact was felt on convention centres , airlines and hotel industry .
Apart from this a downturn was seen even in leisure tourism .
If the reason for it was downsizing by the companies then on the other hand people considered it better not to set out on excursions due to recession .
The major reason for a reduction in the number of inbound tourists in India was terrorism and swine flu .
It 's one positive aspect was this that by not receiving enough booking of foreign tourists tourism industry and government 's attention was diverted to organise and boost domestic tourism .
Tourists adopted the policy of turning long break holiday into short break holiday .
Tourists liked all-inclusive packages the most .
Even honeymoon destinations could not escape from the blow of recession and swine flu .
Even during the peak of wedding season , hotel room booking was less in these areas .
The forts and the ruins of Vishnupur which served as the capital of ` Mallapur ' and the temples situated in them seem to narrate the glorious saga of ancient period .
Where Vishnupur is famous for music families and terracotta temples , it is also famous for various handicraft objects .
This fair held by the name of Vishnupur fair is one of the popular fairs of the state where thousands of people come from not only the state but from various parts of the country .
Crowd pour in here even for handicraft objects .
King Raghunath Singh Dev interested in ' Mall vansh ' gave immense facilities to encourage the art of music in his kingdom by inviting Tansen 's student Bahadur Khan from Delhi .
As a result , Vishnupur gharaana started and today Vishnupur gharaana is counted among the major music gharaanas in the country .
With its unique style of classical and Hindustani music it keeps a distinct identity from the rest of the gharanaas .
Amongst the tourist spots here Raas and Manch Keshavrai temple made in a pyramid style , madan mohan temple , Jar bangla temple and shyam rai temple and keshav rai temple are famous .
In these temples pictures of Ramayana , Mahabharata and historical times have been carved .
Besides these temples Lal dam , Krishna dam , Poka dam constructed in 17th - 18th century are also worth seeing .
Vishnupur is 151 kms from Kolkata through road ways and is at a distance of 34 kms from Bankura .
half the distance I covered as fun .
Suddenly my foot slipped from a rock .
Because of being little tires and because of some burden I fell in water and the bundle fell off far from my head .
Did n't get time to use the stick .
I held the bundle with one hand promptly and started to swim with another .
I was moving forth in deep waters .
At first a thought came to me that if I do the business of saving the bundle then I 'll drown but very soon I thought that without bundle also I will die because I had to walk ten days more and meeting humans on that way was difficult .
Now I realized that I do not have the power to ascend .
Therefore came down so that I will climb after becoming healthy staying beneath the mountain for some days .
After descending for around 5 miles found another river .
Beneath it again was the kingdom of snow .
After seeing this I feared that this time if I have to spend night in such snow then will die for sure .
At that very time only a I heard a bird 's voice .
On looking here and there I came to know that a group of 8 - 10 cranes was playing in the shallow waters of river .
Such a beautiful scene I had never seen .
This river was some 120 yards wide .
I descended to a valley after crossing it .
Therefrom I saw some animals at a distance similar to mountain buffalos .
I had been disillusioned many a times .
Now by their gait did I realize that they are buffaloes  By looking at them came to know that here is a human settlement somewhere near .
Some shepherd was grazing 60 buffalos , when saw up-close .
Came to know when asked that these people had come last evening .
They said at a little .
I started to walked towards it .
Damyanti river was sparkling in front .
On reaching its bank I began to wait for my mates .
When everybody reached then crossed that mountainous river .
The water was till waist in it .
Mules crossed it easily .
Stayed by its edge for the entire day today .
In the evening I kept playing for two hours with stones alone while sitting on the bank of ' Damyanti ' river .
High current was flowing in front .
At 10 ' o clock we reached Gyanima .
many pigeon holes of Huns - extremely trashy and worse than kuchha houses - were made here .
Reader , our meaning by many is from thirty to forty .
Vijay Singh ji put a camp after reaching on his destined spot .
Unloaded all the stuff , dusted the place to make it suitable .
In front of their houses garbage , waste , sheep heads , bones of goats , dung , cow dung , etc . everything was there .
We have to stay for many days at Gyanima .
come first we will tell you something about the condition of Gyanima mandi so that you can draw it 's picture in your mind .
Gyanima Mandi is a big mandi for Indians in western Tibet .
It must be 35 miles away from our Indian border .
In it 's north are the mountain ranges of Teerthpuri and Kailash , Bhot 's area in south , Mansarovar and Mandhata mountain in the east , Toling monastery , daawa and Neti in the west .
This mandi is situated in Gyanima 's huge wide flat field .
Beginning from a height of 15 , 000 feet and gradually towards a slope 0f 14 , 000 feet , Gyanima plateau has gradually gone towards west on the edge of Sutlej valley .
There are absolutely no stones in this plateau . there is much comfort for the traveller to walk . because at various places there are water springs , the land is very cold at night . the snowy caps of Himalayas are also near .
25 July Sunday . In the morning itself we turned towards Teerthpuri after biding farewell to our loving Bhotiyas .
2 . good people came to drop us till a mile .
On a wage of Rs . took along a guide till Teerthpuri .
It was eight already and plains were visible till far ahead of us .
The air here is so clear that the thing far away is clearly visible and the beholder suffers from the illusion of it being near .
When a lot of time has been spent while walking and even then the destined object can be seen right in front , then our folly is realized by us .
After walking for two miles reached on the bank of a lake .
This lake is on an elevated land .
It is known that it 's water springs out of region surrounding Gyanima mandi , or must be some other reason .
Took a short nap here for a while .
Then walking on plains and after crossing a rivulet we reached a pasture .
Many chanvar cows and sheep were grazing here .
The camp of their masters , Huns , was also nearby .
First thought that should stay here , there was danger of robbers ahead , but later we moved ahead putting faith in God .
After crossing this square field we reached beneath a dry hill .
Searched for water here and there but could not find .
Climbed the hill thirsty .
When we reached the other side after crossing this hill a valley was visible ahead .
This is a sandy valley between very small dry hills .
Where will a place better than this worth plundering by robbers will be found .
After drinking the nectar of faith we entered the valley .
The sun set while crossing it .
Reached a spring tired and thirsty .
Very little water was oozing out from here .
We halted at a dry mountain rivulet near this .
Collected cow dung cakes from here and there .
The one who was the guide brought wood .
Ate sattu at night and passed the entire night in front of fire . did n't even take an hour 's sleep .
We set off at five in the morning only on Monday , 26 July .
Reached on the top of the hill with a lot of effort .
Many laden jhabbus -LRB- a cross breed of yak and cow -RRB- were coming here .
Two - three jewel traders were along , their desire was to reach Gyanima .
Right on the banks of the Sutlej river is the famous pilgrimage of Teerthpuri .
There are caves dug in hillocks here to stay , room like structures have been made .
Had to spend night in one such cave .
For their stay lama people have made caves of such a kind .
Those travellers who come to pay visit to the temple of Lord Buddha in Teerthpuri , all of these con them only .
Came after us as well , would ask for sattu continuously .
The night went by some how .
27 July Tuesday : Early morning I went to see hot water springs .
Ona white hill boiled water was emanating out from various places .
At one or two places water was so hot that we could not even touch it .
The boiling water that comes out from these sulphur springs , comes from the devil 's pond under the earth .
Travellers call this place as ' The heap of Bharmasur ' .
Right beneath Mandhata mountain is Taklakot mandi .
Traders from Byaans , Chaudaans , Daarma and Nepal come to sell their products over here .
The Indian name of loss here is ' Lipulekh ' .
It must be 7 miles from Taklakot .
The water of rivers have been utilised through canals , after irrigating land on all sides grain is sown .
Where water has not reached that land has worn baldness .
Rain does not fall much over here , whatever grain is produced here is through irrigation only .
There are 37 villages in the district of Taklakot .
They are settled on the banks of the rivers .
The houses here are of stones , mud is plastered on it . are good for work .
Near every village field of barley and peas were seen .
There was greenery frequently on the way towards Shrikhocharnath monastary .
The land is very fertile .
Do n't know why there was scarcity of trees everywhere ?
the land wherein oats and peas can be there , why ca n't fruit trees be there , looks like nobody gave an attempt .
Underneath snow , like a snake stuck to dark stones , Mandakini was spitting out poison on colliding on stones .
On the both sides of our way wild roses were bursting , with which forest godesses used to decorate themselves , our lives .
Now we were guests of the Himalayas .
After walking some more distance ahead a chatti was found where after staying night long we set out towards Kedarnath .
Kedarnath was left only 3 miles away from here .
1 mile was completed .
2 miles were completed .
because it is climbing path , that is why took time .
Further there are no trees on road but green grass .
Himalya 's daughter Arpana pray to Kedarnath Shankar here , no songs on her lips , no flowers of lust in her heart , she is a pure ascetic in whose eyes rapids of purity are falling and a pure light is reflecting on her face .
Paid visit to Kedarnath temple .
Saw ' त्रयम्बक के राशिभूत अट् टहास ' up close .
Looked on the top of the temple , green grass had gone to .
We have heard that there is a pond named Vaasuki in the waters of which are lotus of various colors .
He becomes deaf , does not listen to anyone , neither understands .
A divine beauty comes on his face and while singing he is lost somewhere behind the mountains forever .
We though that the condition that takes place for those who go to Vaasuki pond , the same condition happened to us while on the way to Kedaarnath .
We came back only with our bodies .
The maidens of vasuki taal stole away our hearts .
I was in Kolkata in the November of 1980 .
Some traps , who wandered on the paths outside the popular paths in Himalayas , came to meet at the end of one journey .
They had also brought colored paardarshiyaan of journey along .
After saying and listening on the topic of the journey , which was specially regarding the snow and glacial path from Raansi to Kedarnath , adviced that when even I have a fondnedd towards the unknown ways then even I should enjoy that journey .
Told us further that in Raansi till Mandani some shepherds go through difficult paths .
After that the way till Kedarnath was unknown and he was one of the first people to walk on that way .
Was given a warning that it wo n't be appropriate to travel during rainy season .
My heart got ready instantly and I even began practical preperations .
It was decided such that let 's travel in the June of 1981 .
First posted a letter to our known porter Jotisingh Rana -LRB- Kunethji  from kalimath -RRB- .
It was written to Bhatt ji that he will arrange for 2 porters and ration , water , kerosene etc as well .
Because we will have to walk for many days above the tree line so kerosene oil is very important .
Jyotisingh also thought that the journey will begin from Helang and not from Kedarnath .
I started preperations after receiving acceptance letters from everyone .
From Helang rached Kolkata on the evening of 14th June .
Luckily Jyotisingh was found in Chamoli only .
He was standing at the bus station in my anticipation .
In Helang we prepared a Mana resident Paansingh as our porter .
He stayed us with Madmaheshwar .
Bought enough ration required till 18th June .
Due to non - availability of any place for night stay the night was spent in the tea staller 's shop and was spent with joy .
In the morning of 15 June all three of us set out after lifting our luggage .
Crossed Alaknand through hanging bridge and while walking on the climbong path reached reached first village ' Salna ' .
Greenery raprured our hearts .
Nainitaal mountaineering club created history by crossing these trails Pass -LRB- 5312 metres -RRB- in the years of its silver jubilee and the birth century year -LRB- 1994 -RRB- of George willaiam Trail .
This pass is known by the name of initial commissioner Trails and is situated on the top of ` Pindari Gul ' .
The importance of Trails pass was in 18th century when traders used to go to Milam valley through it .
Thorough this way Tibet can be reached in very less time .
In the course of ime this path was closed down .
When Trail was appointed the commissioner of Kumauon then he initiated the opening o fthis pass .
He put a proposal to open this path in front of the people of Gori and Pindar valleys .
While crossing Trails pass we considered it safe to go from tough and relatively longer way o fthe southenr slope instead of using the traditional way .
The eastern path from Gull mukh to Trails pass is shorter no doubt , but due to the threats of continous falling pack ice , cracks and icy rocks , the path is full of dangers at every step .
In the last 164 years this way has been passed only five times through thise way .
From southern slope , the path from which we went towards trails pass , we were trapped there for many days on that in October 1972 during Nandakhaat expedition -LRB- 6611 m -RRB- .
Finally we were able to cross it only after using a 142 kms long rope .
On 2 October from ' Surakhrak ' we left for ' Takhta camp ' at a height of 4560 metres .
It is situated on the south eastern slope of Nandakhat peak .
Its naming was done due to plates suppressed in ice and stones during Nandakhat campaign of 1972 .
Possibly they were used at some time to cross the snow crevices .
They were lying as it is due to being there in snow .
We made one or two boards stand upright after taking them out so that mountaineers coming from down should know the situation of camp .
In the early morning of 8th October we leaped towards the Trails pass empty handed .
In half an hour we were at the pass .
Today we were successful in reaching till this destination after 53 years .
From Trails pass the main and the eastern summits of Nandadevi can be seen right in front .
Longstaff coal is also right in front which joins Nandadevi with Nandakhaat of yesteryears and creates the outer wall of Nandadevi sanctuary .
On the pass we hoist flags of our country , Nainital mountaineering club , mountain -LRB- Askot - Arakot mission -RRB- and of mataji of Arvind Ashram .
Today we had cleared the aim which was invincible and difficult .
In this way we had repeated history by reaching here after 53 years .
All members were happy and thrilled .
After photography we returned to the camp and taking luggage from there we returned to the pass .
A marvellous sight was there when we woke up on the morning of 10th October .
Wherefrom we had descended down yesterday that lane was looking clear .
Nanda Devi east and Longstaff Kol in front were looking really high .
A sheet of golden sunlight was laid .
On all four sides were hanging glaciers , seerecs , and snow cracks .
In the happiness of passing trails pass we congratulated and hugged each other .
It was team spirit only due to which we were able to cross all dangers successfully .
After tea jumping through cracks we moved left towards Nandadevi .
He welcomed us warmly and served tea .
Slide film was finished with me .
He gave me that too happily .
On one side grand scene of eastern peak of Nandadevi is seen from this place then on the other hand while descending down to Martoli Nandakot and Kuchela peaks are seen together .
We had to go through Moraine ahead wherein a beautiful pond was also there .
There were heaps of Bhojpatra and Juniper leaves at one place which had come down sliding from snow .
This area was burnt badly by ' musk ' hunters .
Today we reached ' Lavaan ' village at 7 p . . after walking for about 30 kms .
Only one family stays over here .
The entire village has turned into ruins .
The source of water is also far .
We got rice from the porters of Spanish group .
Today the delicious food we had of rice and potato curry after three days , it 's taste we will not be forgotten in life .
In the morning began to climb the steep mountain and after climbing for an hour we were in ' Taati Thalkot Bugyal ' .
Anwaal Daansingh returning from Chafua was from a village named Kanyaari .
They were descending a herd of around 300 sheep .
He told us that eight herds of sheep ranging from small to large are there in their village , in which there are around 2000 sheep .
Another series of ascent to ' Talla Rantham ' and then ' Malla Rantham ' from Chafua .
We were standing at such a point on the mountain peak at a height of about 3 , 368 metres wherefrom we were able to see till far in all the directions .
we reached Rahaalivinaayak after crossing ' Naumra Ghaanghal ' in the morning and then Ghatuli after crossing crooked paths .
There is a dispersion of unbridled huge boulders in the entire region .
Looking at it seems like that sometime in the past some big natural activity must have taken place here .
In Chhiplakot also we crossed ghanghals of this kind .
If seen in a geological map then M . . . -LRB- Main Central Thrust -RRB- passes through these areas and it is very much possible that this form of nature came about because of this .
Reached Nandakund after Ghatuli .
The expanse of the sarovar was huge but because of the melting of gull water content had decreased .
Even then nandakund had its own charm .
From some villages around Namik and Munsyari ' Nandajat ' comes here on the day of Nandashtami .
Like Gadhwal the festival of Nanadpujan is celebrated with a lot of fervor and enthusiasm in Jauhar .
On this occasion zonal fairs come together in Milan and Martauli villages .
On this occasion people separated from their ancestral houses return to their origins .
In the standing rocky area we reached the next mountain range with the help of a track , from where big parts of Naamik and Anargaal are visible .
We were thrilled after nearing our aim .
It was the sixth day of the journey .
In the morning at 5 a . . only we left to see gull from our camps in Namik Bugyal .
After climbing approximately 2 k . . we were at such a spot where the undulating Namik glacier comes before us in its entirety .
Sparkling in the first rays of the sun the glacier was delighting us till the limit of hypnotism .
Due to the cracks on the glacier it was not possible to cross it .
Neither was there a way to climb up .
Therefore while balancing amongst moraines we descended down to zero point .
There is no depressing expanse of moraines around Naamik gull the one that we saw at gulls like Chatrungi , Milam , Balaati , Panchachuli or Bumraasa etc .
In Namik Bugyal it got afternoon till the time we reached our camp and the weather had started to turn morose .
First rain and then hail started coming .
In a while the peaks turned white .
Along with the fall in temperature in October , snowfall is normal in this area .
The fog emanating from Ramganga , spreading around us on all sides had covered Namik gull and the summits around and we hid in our camps to escape from the cold .
Ramda had heard from his ancestors that years before British used to row a boat like thing on snow -LRB- must be skiing -RRB- .
Since the time Ramda told us this point a question was continuously arising in my mind if there were any possibilities of brave tourism in the birth place of Ramganga .
Now after seeing this area for maximum time we all mates of ' mountain group ' who reached here were of the same view that if the way from Thalgawaar to Namik gull is marked then trekkers can immensely enjoy the beauty of Nandakund , Hiramani and Namik .
If few facilities can be developed here then the flux of tourists moving towards Pindar can be turned towards this side and in next stages camping around Balsan Kund and skiing in ' Thalagwar ' can be developed .
This was our own belief .
The question is of the thinking of the planners of the tactics of tourism development in Uttrakhand .
Of identification of new places for the purpose of tourism and of decentralisation of tourism as well .
Bhotiya people reside near us only , in many hamlets during winters .
Often when they came to the village they would discuss about Tibet trade for sure .
Used to listen its tales from grandmother with much interest during childhood .
With this the desire to see this places kept increasing .
The information that the path to Malari emerges from Milam , the frontier region of Pithaurgarh , was received after arrival at Gopeshwar from Ms . Snehlata Joshi .
She was appointed principal in girls ' school .
When she came to Gopeshwar for the first time then made a mind to travel the border area on foot and in September 2000 took Rudrasingh along from Gopeshwar and reached malari .
2 k . . ahead from here is ' Buransh ' hamlet where Dhauli coming from Neeti and Girthi coming from Unta dhara meet .
In front of it in right in the middle of the two valleys is the Kailahpur old village .
Dhauli valley towards the top becomes relatively flat .
The land is worth farming .
The roads and passes used for Tibet trade are near .
Accordingly many villages of the tribe are settled here .
Farkiya , Baampa and Gamshaali villages are situated on the left shore of Dhauli , 10 kms above Kailashpur .
Five kilometres ahead of gamshaali is situated Neeti village .
A motor road is being made from Buransh to Neeti which till Gamshaali is makeshift .
At times jeeps etc are able to go there .
Due to excessive snowfall people stay here only during summers .
On the other hand 14 kms road has been constructed with geerthi gaad .
Can be visited only after taking a permit .
Our journey is along Girthi .
Rudrasingh and me had come from Malari to Buransh in the morning itself where we were waiting for a vehicle for further ahead .
The entire day had passed .
At 4 in the evening the truck agreed to move ahead .
In a distance of 14 kms we reach 14 metres above directly from 10 metres .
This journey 14 kms from Buransh was completed in 2 hours .
The army calls this place by the name of 16 point .
During the olden times it was called as ' Brahmahatya ' .
There is a dwelling of the snake God in Rampagat . shepherd told so .
A folk tale is popular here that when the path was being paved here then the labourers had a view of the Snake God in the form of a monkey .
usually monkeys are not seen here but when they are seen then they are welcomed warmly .
The way ahead of Rampadhar was dangerous .
The path was paved keeping in view the commutation of mules .
In a straight line below , at a depth of 2 kms tributary of Girthi was flowing noisily .
The path would be a little more wide than 2 foot .
On going at the edge dizziness was felt .
A little carelessness and the fear of falling in the deep gorge .
The hill on which this path was paved was completely deserted and on the hill on the other side there were trees grown in a scattered pattern .
It is called ' Seesa ' mountain .
It is told that before there was a thick forest on all four sides of Seesa mountain , primarily of ' Kail ' .
This forest got destroyed due to landslide from both the sides .
Around 1930 major destruction took place here .
A pond got made from the debris that came from landslide .
Water filled till the bridge .
At that time could come and go with sheep and goats only .
To keep this path communicable 24 hours the labourers of People 's Welfare Department were stationed there .
After 1 kilometre we reached Chhyudang .
On a slope Fiah were standing in large numbers .
standing on their front feet these animals basking in the sun looked like as if they were greeting sun .
Chhyudang is also a word of Tibetan language whose meaning is water of rock .
Here water was flowing from beneath the water .
Were moving ahead on the slope of Unta dhura while paving way from freshly laid snow .
We had reached Unta Dhura .
winds blowing at Dhura had increased in speed due to hide and seek by clouds .
Sat over there for some time .
The feeling which was being experienced while sitting in this uninhabited but most beautiful place can not be stated in words .
The hills that I used to see since childhood from my village , that time we were standing right behind them .
The peak of Nandadevi was on our right side .
Till Manusyari now , we had to descend on slope only .
The weather was clear .
The path was along Gori , Ganga 's tributary emanating from the gull nearby .
Are reached in a valley beneath .
The name of the place is Bamrana .
Across the bridge till Simaldandi the way was plain .
On the right side of the river Himalyan Blue Sheep were grazing grass .
There was a slope again from Simaldandi .
We were going by the older path only .
Landslide had erased the traces of the path ahead .
Crossed Landslide taking risk .
We reached Dung after some time .
Next day reached Milam at 11 passing from Solang , Samgaon .
We left for Baumdila in the morning at six by state transport bus from Itanagar .
Around 12 the bus halted at Bhalukpong for lunch .
Bhalukpong is a historical spot of Arunachal .
Situated at the border of Assam - Arunachal on the banks of a river , it is a very popular picnic spot .
To go ahead from here ' Inner Line Permit ' is required .
By walking a little more ahead from here is ' Tee Pee Orchid Sanctuary ' .
Many rare species of Orchids are seen here in abundance .
Arunachal is known for the most number of ' Orchid species ' in India .
Craft center ' and other emporiums of market are filled with the souvenirs , primarily art works , colorful wooden utensils etc .
Buddhist works of art , whether they are on canvas or on the wooden utensils , looks very attractive and tourists naturally pine for them after looking at them .
The vehicle going from Tawang to Tejpur reached Bumdilla at around 11 at night .
All the employees of Hotel La were present to help us board the vehicle .
How intimate all of them had become in one day 's familiarity .
The vehicle was full but we finally got to sit at the last seat .
To sit in a crowded bus while wearing a blanket in icy winter is an enjoyable experience .
With a slow speed , the bus is now on a descent after crossing the heights of ' Baumdilla ' that is Baumdi pass .
The Dirang river flowing in Dirang valley was sparkling in the full moon night .
The ascent starts again from Dirang .
From the right side the way cuts off for ' Saangti ' .
Somewhere on Tawang path ahead is ' Nikamadaang ' soldier base , where we had gone in 1982 .
At 6 in the morning the vehicle halted at a tea shop .
It 's drizzling a little , temperature is a little less than zero degrees .
I enjoy tea while chatting with the soldiers of Jaat Regiment standing in front of a silo .
14 , 000 feet high Sela pass was covered with fresh snow .
Besides Forest rest house there is good arrangement to stay here at Circuit house , Rest house and many hotels of tourist departments .
It was pretty cold even in April in Twang situated at a height of 10 , 000 feet .
The caretaker Radhe lit bukhaari after a dinner of Lentils , Chapattis and ferns .
We did n't come to know when sleep engulfed us after daylong fatigue in the comfortable warm room .

There is ' Naag Temple ' here nearby .
At various places ' The snakes here do not bite , please do not kill them ' .
Reached Bhalukpong at the time of sunset .
Sunset looks very attractive here .
Now we had reached in a plain area .
We have left behind those old faces who even today raise their heads in the memory of 1962 war , those young monks who unintroduced with the terror of war , devoted to everlasting peace , are the symbols of future .

There is a lot to see and to enjoy in Taiwan which attract tourists towards it .
Today we are taking you to the National museum there where the history of 9 eras is alive .
Tai Pe museum in itself is a collection of China , Taiwan and to a large extent Ancient Indian art , culture , lifestyle and historical importance .
In this three storied building everything has been treasured which gives form to the ancient history and Taiwan and China .
Soon after entering this museum you can feel the life style of the 12th to 21st century from very close .
Were surprised then , when written copper plates were kept in a very large section .
Our guide Le - Fung told us that these copper plates are of the times of Shang dynasty .
It is said that with this dynasty coming to rule the real history of China and Taiwan begins .
They had relations with India 's Hun dynasty and these symbols have been kept in their memory .
In this museum the series of the development of human society has been strung in a very marvellous way .
The glimpses of a luxurious lifestyle of royalties and struggle filled lives of common man is clearly visible here .
All the steps of education , culture , social , religious and economic prosperity have been treasured in a wonderful way in this museum .
The pre - historical journey of art - culture and literature has also been underlined .
After visiting the museum one feels the feeling of one complete Asia continent .
Asia continent is the largest continent of the world .
It 's expanse is 1 crore 75 lakh square miles .
It covers One third portion of the entire world and is four times bigger than Europe continent .
During the journey of Tai Pe National Museum it feels that despite high variation there is unity in Asia .
First of all Asia is divided into Sea and rivers .
Deserts and mountains in this continent also separate the countries from each other .
In the entire Asia there are various kinds Political apparatuses and some of them are dramatically opposite to each other .
The examples of China and Taiwan are in front of us .
Where China has a very capitalist and dictatorial views , Taiwan is completely a democratic country .
The thinking of Taiwan is very close to that of India .
The Lifestyle gallery of museum makes us feel that in many aspects like lifestyle , eating habits , beliefs and behavior we are not in mutual agreement but despite this , Buddhism , Islam , Hinduism and Sikhism which are spread in large part of Asia - have tied us together in many aspects .
It has been shown in the art - culture gallery of the museum that there were many similarities in the ancient civilisations of China , Mesopotamia , Babylonia and Sindhu valley .
It 's strange , but even then it is an established fact that even centuries after the extinction of these civilizations we understand their contribution even today .
Even today these civilizations and their ruins string us in one bond .
In this section only the economic development of Taiwan has been shown by associating it with the rest of Asia .
Historical evidence are testimony to this point that in past that there were mutual commercial relations among the Asian countries and today we want to develop them continuously .
As and by Asia developed , exploitation by the Europeans also ended .
In the historical section of the museum the social developmental stream of East Asia -LRB- Taiwan , Korea , Japan -RRB- , South east Asia -LRB- Myanmar , Vietnam , Cambodia , Laos , Malaya , Sumatra , Java and Philippines -RRB- , and Middle Asia have been exhibited .
The officials associated with the museum tell us that we people do not know much about the situation of China between 7000 B . . To 3000 B . .
On the basis of available records it is known that in around 3000 B . . Chinese society was feudalistic in nature and the entire China was under the control of Feudal lords .
On the other hand by the religious ruins of this period found in Taiwanese area one comes to know that people here were very decent and God fearing .
After this the prosperity series of the empires has been exhibited , in which Han dynasty -LRB- the first empire of China -RRB- , Tang dynasty , Sung royal family , Ming dynasty and Manchu are included .
The biggest speciality of this museum is this that whatever remains Taiwanese researchers found in various countries besides Taiwan , they brought them along and submitted to the museum .
This international museum not only exhibits the pre historic situations but associate them with the modern lifestyle as well .
Initially it was in a very small form , later in 1965 the government gave it a new form and opened it for the public .
Since then continuous improvements are being done in it .
The plain meaning of ice skating is to saunter on ice with the help of ice skates .
These ice skates are a special kind of shoes , the blades attached to which helps you in galloping .
If for some people ice skating is a mode of tafrih , then some play various amusing games with it 's help .
The fun which it is to skate on frozen lake or river , that is very difficult to describe in words .
Maximum fun of skating comes in games like Bunday , Ice hockey , Ringette .
In these very exciting games played on snow goals are to shot against the rival 's team with the help of sticks .
Bundae game is like football .
There are 11 players with every team , of which one player is a goalkeeper .
In this game one has to deliver the ball in the opponent 's goalpost .
The excitement of this game running in two halves of 45 minutes each is heightened when seen .
If talking about ice hockey , then there is puck -LRB- instead -RRB- instead of ball .
Both the teams try to deliver this puck in the opponent 's goal post .
In every team there are five skaters and one goalkeeper .
The hangover of ice hockey is on the entire world but it is especially famous in countries like Russia and Canada .
Mainly women play Ringette .
In it a rubber ball has to be sent in a goalpost with the help of a stick .
In this game also every team has 6 players .
The specialists in skating set out on a long trip on natural ice in a group and call it Ture skating .
This trend is rising rapidly in Sweden , Finland and Norway .
The most famous art of skating is figure or artistic skating .
In the ice court a marvellous scene is presented when couples roam on all sides hand in hand .
Anyone can be spellbound by looking at their footwork .
Couples drenched in merrymaking sway to and fro on snow and the clapping of audiences start reverberates in the hall .
On the rhythm of music with flexibility of body , months of practice is easily visible in this game .
It is an Olympic game which is exhibited as a couple or in a group .
Similar to it is synchronised skating .
In it from 8 to 20 boys and girls in a disciplined and harmonious way exhibit their art on ice in full speed .
To entertain people by presenting oneself on ice is actually an arduous task .
The feeling refused to leave .
There is a vehicle or an instrument in sledge riding , with the help of which you can roam around on ice track .
Enjoy the experience of snow by sitting on it with your partner , wo n't forget this for lifetime .
In ski bobbing instead of ski wheels there is a cycle like frame , with the help of which covering snowy paths is enjoyed .
In a similar way snowmobile is a vehicle to cover long distances of snowy paths , there is a place like a chair to sit .
Snow has started to fall in the months of winter on hill stations of the country and the atmosphere is very pleasant .
It is the best time for those who are besotted with snow games .
Places like Kashmir , Gulmarg , Auli are the best for snow games during light winters .
Tourists from all over the nation come to Himalayan valleys to see astonishing games of professional players on the snow laden high peaks .
Who would want to leave the opportunity of enjoying with snow games on now mountains , so get ready for a cold weather laced with energy .
To look at the valleys of Himalayas from Auli , nestled in the mountains of Himalayas in the Chamoli district of Uttrakhand , is a comforting experience .
This meadow situated in eastern gadhwal is at an approximate height of 10,000 foot .
To stare at surrounding mountain peaks of 20 , 000 feet height gives a very happy feeling .
Away from clamor and din Auli will sooth and will also be exciting .
Auli is like a heaven for lovers of skiing and professional and amateur players because the spiralling soft snow and shining slopes give them a magical feel .
Auli is like a school for novice where if they learn lessons of skiing then the slopes here also take their exam .
Kalinga war is believed to be the most frightening war in the Indian history .
It was after this war that there was a change of heart of Emperor Ashoka and from being cruel Ashoka he was known as Dhammashoka meaning Ashoka - the follower of Dharma .
The mountain of Dhauli around 8 kms away from Bhubhneshwar always freshens the memory of that two thousand year old battle and his conversion to Buddhism as well .
On the top of this very hill of Dhauli is a stupa , then there are orders pertaining to Ashoka period engraved on rocks .
If this hill of Dhauli had seen that war then it saw those post war activities also , which ran on that hill after Ashoka converted to Buddhism .
Although Shanti stupa made on the top of Dhauli 's mountain is only 37 years old , which was made very late .
But on its base at some time was ` Aradhyavarti ' Buddhist monastery .
Although the traces of Kalinga war are not found today .
But orders of Ashoka can be seen on the rocks situated on the base of Dhauli mountain .
Ashoka of the Maurya dynasty was the most ambitious of all the brothers , this is why his step brothers started to envy him .
To sideline Ashok they tried many failed attempts .
Whatever responsibilities father Bimbasaar gave , he was successful in them .
This is why he became the most natural heir to Bimbasaar to take his place .
Highly ambitious Ashoka wanted the seat of Patliputra , which could not be acquired without finishing off brother Sisuma .
This is why when the Maurya King died then to acquire the power of Patliputra Ashoka had to finish off his brother .
After gaining the power of Maurya empire he ran many missions to fulfil his dream of being victorious all over .
Due to him being powerful many kingdoms instead of fighting kept accepting his captivity .
Initially he won kingdoms near and far .
Before capturing Kalinga his border had spread from today 's Myanmar , Bangladesh in far east to Pakistan , Afghanistan , and Iran in west .
But Kalinga was the only kingdom in the south of Magadh , which refused to accept Ashoka 's captivity .
His predecessors had also dreamt of winning Kalinga , because during the reign of King Nanda Kalinga was a part of Magadh only , but soon after a coup Kalinga became an independent state .
Even Bindusaar used to dream about winning Kalinga .
This is why the king of Kalinga gave refuge to Ashoka 's stepbrother , then Ashoka 's brows were raised .
On this Ashoka asked the king of Kalinga to surrender .
On rejection Ashok attacked Kalinga with a huge army , in which he was victorious .
After being glorious with victory when emperor Ashoka set out on a tour of Kalinga 's capital then for once he was confused on seeing the scene if it was his victory or defeat .
On seeing houses turned to ruins on all four sides , burnt - half burnt buildings , amputated dead bodies , the injured waiting for death , wailing children and women , crying elderly people , dead and injured animals , blood laced roads .
This was the first time when strong Ashoka resolved to conquer all directions was troubled even after being victorious .
Those scenes and those things spent in Ujjain 's Buddhist monastery were coming repeatedly in front of his eyes where he was treated during the time he was injured .
Even after returning to Patliputra from Kalinga , Ashoka 's mind was not at peace .
The falling of snow is a romantic feeling and a synonym to fun and frolic as well .
To see the falling swabs of cotton falling from sky , to try and hold them in fists and in this attempt to be covered in a white shawl from head to toe is such an ethereal feeling which can not be described in words .
When snow falls then it seems that the unbridled youth of nature is blooming after being intoxicated .
Nature is giving a mute invitation to lovers to come out of their homes and dance with this youth .
These butterflies descended from sky in the form of cotton swabs sit on people 's shoulders , hands and bodies with so much intimacy as if they have come to lavish their full love on them .
In the wait of these butterflies the excitement of the tourists settled on the mountains since many days know no bounds .
They clasp these butterflies tightly in their fists and throw on each other 's bodies happily .
The opening shutters of cameras try and capture theses scenes .
Children find a new game .
All children become sculptors .
The artist inside everyone wakes up .
When the winter season knocks then phone calls start coming from friends and relatives residing on plains .
The curiosity is only one , whether snow has fallen or not or if there are any signs of snowfall .
Winter season brings a gift of snow for those who stay on hills stations and also an opportunity for hospitality of friends and guests .
Come winters and earth remains devoid of snow ornamentation , at least it can not happen in the .
Be it twice but snow falls for sure during winters and the hills of these states become more beautiful soon after receiving the gift of snow .
To treasure the memories of their honeymoon newly married couples visit tourist spots like the queen of mountains Shimla , Kullu - Manali , Dalhousie , Dharamshala , Kasauli , Patni Top , Srinagar , Gulmarg , Kausaani , Gadhwaal , Missouri etc .
The scene of Mall road and Ridge of Shimla is worth seeing .
When snow falls then to skate on snow covered mountains , to slide on slopes becomes very thrilling .
It is during these days that Winter Sports are organised .
water freezes in taps , scarcity of food and water is felt .
In some valleys of Himachal Pradesh festivals galore on the farewell of winters .
In this festival people meet as if those separated since ages are meeting .
The lakes frozen in ice beckon those who love thrill .
Have you ever saundered on any lake ?
You may be hoodwinked perhaps with this question , but kids squander on lakes situated in the tribal areas of Himachal and skating lovers cover the length and breadth of lake .

The lakes of Himachal wear a sheet of snow , of them lake of Kinnaur , Manimahesh lake of Chamba , Surajtal and Chandratal of Lahaul , Chandrahaan of Shimla district , dashahaar lake of Kullu district and Prashar lake of Mandi are main .
Nako lake is situated in Nako village situated seven kilometres above sub tehsil headquarters Yagchang situated on Ambala Kaurik national highway 320 kms away from Shimla and because of this lake the village got its name Nako .
In winters when Nako lake freezes then locals enjoy skating on it .
Thrill lovers are always in the wait when winters will knock and when will they set out to cover lakes on the pretext of skating .
Besides being bestowed with natural beauty , Manimahesh lake , situated in the zone of Kailash mountain at a height of 18 , 000 kms in tribal Bharmaour area of Chamba district , is also mentioned in many stories .

Here are around two dozen lakes of all sizes of which surajtaal and chandrataal are main .
Surajtal is situated at a height of 4697 meters from Baralacha pass whereas chandrataal lake is only 6 kms far away from Gunjam pass .
A magical raaga starts to run in the water reservoirs of Himachal as soon as winter knocks that which hypnotises nature lovers and along side also fills in a new music in their hearts .
The creators of this raga are migratory birds , the fluttering of whose wings seem to be giving a beat to their raaga .
These birds have to depart towards those reservoirs of India where abundant vegetation is available .
Those water reservoirs towards which maximum migratory birds turn their face many reservoirs of them are situated in the beautiful valleys of Himachal .
Of them Pang reservoir , Gobind sagar reservoir , Renuka lake , and an area named ' Balla ' in Hamirpur district are main .
Of them Pong reservoir is a favorite spot for migratory birds .

It is believed that if this lake is also developed in the form a colony for migratory birds then like Pong lake this lake can also become a home for a large number of migratory birds .
Major life scientist Dr . Ramlakhan Singh has concluded in his long research that when these migratory birds come towards India in a group , then offsprings born in that very season , in their first foreign flight , while flying ahead of the group they land right at that place where last year their parents had landed .
Contrary to this while returning to their native country in march after spending winters , that female bird leads the group who lay eggs on its motherland right at the moment it arrival .

Vishnuganga emanating from north west and dhauli river emanating from north east meet over here .
Vishnuprayag onwards it is called as Alaknanda river .
Many rivers flowing at high speed meet in the way flowing from the higher Himalayan range on the steep slope .
In Nandprayag Mandakini river flowing from east to west with Alaknanda moves ahead after making a confluence .

Man is performing destruction on mountains .
Last year itself one reason for destruction in the Bangad area of Tihri Gadhwal -LRB- Sikhdi village and nearby areas -RRB- Kyaarki village of Chamoli Gadhwal was inefficient construction work .
Canal made on Pautha village near sikhaadi village exposed the mask of the inefficient works of the irrigation department .
The work was done with sand and gravel mainly in the canal instead of cement .
Which was uprooted in one rain splash only .
When the canal broke then the dash of water moved ahead destroying Pauntha village .

In the holy spot of Gangotri Dhaam in Utrakhand situated at a height of 3028 metres above sea level and queues of toilets made of sackcloth have been laid on the banks of Ganga , disgrace has been brought upon the beauty of Gangotri .
With the step of making this pilgrim in a tourist spot , it has turning into a .
After depleting forests the way a jungle of cement and concrete is prospering here and pollution is increasing , Gangotri is continuously losing its beauty because of it .
Amongst all the four holy dhaams in Gadhwal zone the name of Gangotri dhaam is taken with a lot of respect .
It is said that king Bhagirath had called down the heavenly Ganga on earth after undergoing a strong penance here .
Gangotri temple , Bhagirath Rock , Gaurikund waterfall etc here are worth a visit and reverence .
The birthplace of Ganga , Gaumukh glacier is 18 kms left from here .
Travellers and tourists reach till Tapovana , Nandaban , and mountaineering Kedardom , Shivling summit .
Drinking water plan in this birthplace sector of Ganga is destructive due to which stand posts here have dried today .
These days people are coerced to drink water mixed with melting glaciers and mud , sand , stones .
In totality the uselessness of the district administration is revealed in open in the crumbling travel arrangements in Gangotri .
The contrary reports that were coming about the situation of the lake built on Bhagirathi as a result of severe landslide near Dabraani on the Gangotri path around 55 kms far from Uttarkashi , only misgivings are solidified and then it feels that preparation of a catastrophe is going on the Bhagirathi valley .
Although the pilgrims trapped on the Gangotri road have been taken to a safe spot eventually .
Gaumukh pilgrimage , the origin place of Ganga is the center of the devotion of religious pilgrims , since one to two decades it has become a spot of attraction and special fascination of nature lovers , now every year more and more pilgrims and tourists have started to come to this area .
Nandan Van and Tapovan , ahead of Gaumukh has also become a heaven of brave wanderers .
But this time the worst earthquake of this century destroyed the beauty of this area to a large extent .
On the main gate of Gaumukh are so many rocks of mud , snow and stones are settled that the place of origin has been covered .
The front portion of the famous Gaumukh glacier has crumbled into pieces .
While remembering the mishap of earthquake , the people of laal Bihari Ashram Bhojwaasa told that on that horrible night around 200 travellers were resting here .
Due to heavy vibration some travellers came out , some were left inside only .
Heavy noise of mountains was heard and rocks started to fall .
Spark emanated due to friction .
A few travellers were injured due to being hit by rocks .
Travellers dumbfounded by this mishap were left trapped here .
On 22 October army helicopter loaded injured travellers .
The remaining travellers reached Gangotri somehow .
Due to earthquake small and long crevices have formed in all the houses in Gangotri pilgrimage .
Rocks came rolling from mountains from all four sides and many crevices were formed in the main temple .
A lot of mud has fallen from the towers on all four sides .
In the perambulation lane there are cracks on the outer wall of the garbhgraha .
People associated with temple committee have estimated the loss till 25 lakhs .
Besides this Mauni Baba , Ashram , Modi Bhawan , Ganga Jamuna Lodge Forest protection Residence , Forest department rest house , Dandi Ashram , residences of locals and many other buildings have been destroyed .
Although no building has collapsed here and no loss of any kind took place .
The broken river bank in front of bhagirathi rock and waterfall has broken even more now and the commuting path and some houses are in direct danger .
The secretary of temple committee Ramesh Chandra Semwal told that on earthquake 's night around 800 pilgrims were in this dhaam .
Some 200 travellers were in Bhojwasa while returning from Gaumukh journey which means that around one thousand travellers were in this area , they told that the media publicised that 200 - 250 passengers were trapped in Gangotri , that was basically said about the travellers trapped in Gaumukh area .
Gaumukh was only called as Gangotri .
Semwal told that on 21 October Border Roads Organisation and army soldiers opened the damaged motor road from Gangotri to Harsil for traffic and then maximum travellers reached Harsil .
Some injured travellers trapped in Gaumukh and Gangotri were taken back by a helicopter .
From harsil also travellers were taken in helicopters .
Two 20 seater planes took 147 travellers in one round .
Many travellers and earthquake effected people went walking to Uttarkashi through the dangerous paths from Harsil to Behad .
Locals told that due to expansive landslide , cracks and rolling of stones the road has broken badly from many places .
Till Bhairav valley Public works Department and ahead of it soldiers of Border roads organization repaired rapidly the road working day and night untiringly .
The eye witnesses told that when people came out praying for their lives along with the earthquake then hey got scared by the noises of rocks rolling and stones falling from Bhairon jhaap hill along with the hill in Kedaar taal direction .
Thankfully houses fell and no mishap occurred .
On hearing the extensively painful disaster in Uttarkashi and Tihri on the second day of earthquake , the priests and employees of the temple got scared and to take information about their families they went to their relative villages crossing dangerous ways .
Only a few people were left in Gangotri .
Due to the threat of possible danger some more went away .
Gangotri dhaam was deserted .
The arrival of people towards Gangotri began since 3 . November .
By the time doors were closed 200 people could reach here .
Exactly at 11 doors of the temple were closed .
On this occasion the soldiers of 9th Gadhwal Rifles who came from Harsil played band and the palanquin along with hundreds of people moved towards Mukhwa village -LRB- Mukhimath -RRB- .
On 8th November the palanquin reached Mukhwa , its winter seat .
Due to the gross tragedy of earthquake this time there was no excitement and chahal pahal and neither were tourists present on the occasion of door closing .
The priests and employees of Gangotri Dhaam have given a description of the destruction in their village Mukhva by mentioning the destruction of temples and homes by sending a memorandum to the government and administration and have also asked for the relocation of villagers at another place .
The villagers told that the famous temple of ` mukhva ' has cracked and a 50 meter long crack has developed .
The new residence also broke apart and the under construction bridge was also destroyed .
A crevice has been formed in the mountain above the village .
Due to a shower of rocks from Varunaavat mountains government as well as non government property worth 1 crore has been wasted .
After a survey of Landslide effected area it has become clear that now varunaavat mountain can finish half the city .
Looking at this the administration has issued notice to evacuate ' Tambakhaani ' .
On the other hand the traders upset due to this incident kept their enterprises closed and a lot of hotch - potch was there in the city throughout the day .
It has been three days today that Varunavat mountain is crumbling .
In these three days hotel Relax , Vijayraj , Mandakini , considered to be the glory of the city till now have been destroyed completely .
Stones from Tambakhaani are showering on these five storied hotels like bullets .
Besides this two dozen residential buildings have been broken after becoming a target to rocks .
Ganga Bhagirathi lodge , Satkar Semwal Hotel also became a target of rocks .
The value of the things destroyed in the landslide along with color TV . double bed , tape recorder , mirrors in five storied buildings of Hotel Mandakini , Relax and Vijayraaj is estimated to be around one crore .
After colliding with these buildings stones and debris were being stopped but now debris and stones had filled the highest point of these buildings .
The rocks falling from this mountain are now directly reaching till the Ramlila ground .
Last night much destruction took place as compared to other days .
After watching the spectacle of destruction by the falling rocks from varunaavat people are evacuating houses proactively .
With this the number of families vacating houses is now 250 from 150 but no one went to the shelters of the district administration even today .
Now making changes in these facilities the collector has opened the doors of other rest houses for the effected people along with Dandi Ashram .
Today in the afternoon the district collector Kamalesh Kumar Pant along with the team of officers landslide affected areas of Varunavat mountains surprising facts have come to the fore .
Varunavat mountain is crumbling down by cracking from three sides .
The first part began to crack in the earthquake of year 1991 and now it began to crack more and now it is cracking at a high speed .
Due to this a question mark has been raised on the opening of Hrishikesh - Gangotri national highway in future for commuting .
The second portion of this mountain started to crack since last Wednesday .
This cracking portion has destroyed the biggest residential area of the city till now .
By the crumbling of this area towards the city landslided within the domain of one kilometre approximately , half the Uttrakashi will be finished .
At present two and half kilometre of this area , 900 kms away from this peak , is under the influence of landslide .

It is like our Holi festival but the difference is in India water mixed with color is thrown on each other whereas over here only fragrance is mixed in water .
There is also a temple of snakes in Penang which locals call by the name ' Chor su Kong ' .
It is believed that for the protection of the idol of this temple these snakes had spread in the entire temple which can be seen crawling on plants with green leaves even today .

A few days back because of some free time in hand I made a plan to visit Scotland and reached there .
To reach there a very long journey via Helsinki to London and Glasgow had to be undergone .
After this I reached a very small village named Loch Lomond about 40 kms drive from the airport .

My last trip is of Lonavla where I went with my friends on weekend .
The beautiful waterfalls there are still settled in my eyes .
I am a struggling model this is why did not get many chances to go out .
But it was my luck that for my very first film I got a chance to go abroad for shooting and that too in London .
I enjoyed this schedule of mine a lot .
I like Goa a lot in India .
And if got a chance to go out of India then would like to go to Egypt .
The pyramids and mummies there attract me a lot since childhood .
I want to go there and see everything .
Apart from Egypt , Mauritius is also my destination .
The days spent in London are memorable for me .
Actually I had never been there before this .
When I was going for shooting from my hotel in car then a very beautiful building was seen .
I asked my driver what it was so he replied ' Buckingham Palace ' .
But I had seen that palace in films and in movies and it didn ' t seem like that to me .
I asked him again then he said that it was the back side of the palace .
After this when again I crossed the same place with my friend . asked him the same question .
He told me that it was a station there .
After this incident I decided that before going anywhere I will take complete knowledge of that place and will take that information from a trustworthy person only .
I set out after taking care every thing and always check while going out if anything has been left or not .
This advice I will give to my friends as well .
When I go somewhere then I really enjoy the popular things there and shopping .
I specially buy something or the other for my friends daughter .
One more thing is always included in my shopping agenda .
Actually my feet are very large and shoes of their measurement are not found easily .
This is why whenever I go anywhere I make sure to find shoes for myself .
In our country Kashmir is known as paradise because of its beauty .
Was planning to see this heaven from a long time and I finally accomplished it last year .
Really , the land of Kashmir is very beautiful and divinity has bestowed boundless love on it .
Staying in houseboat was like living a dream .
At that time it felt that if only time stopped then and I keep living these moments .
But there is grief about the fact that the time I stayed amidst those beautiful valleys . always felt fear and insecurity in the atmosphere there .
The happiness which should have been there because of living in such a beautiful place . have never felt that before .
Rather I always felt a question in their eyes .
This feeling will come to me by looking at heaven from so close . had never thought it before .
After returning from there I am praying that the life of that beautiful place should also be exactly beautiful .

The colorful city Dubai alluring tourists is such a dream of thousand of people which everyone wish to see .
There is no doubt that Dubai is capable of fulfilling every desire , every aim , every fascination and every kind of shopping of people .
But since about one year Dubai is struggling with legacy and modernisation because on one hand Dubai government wants to treasure its ancient tradition and heritage of legacy and on the other hand also wish to stay ahead in every race of the world .
In this race due to globalisation where the entire world has been affected there Dubai ' s economy has also creaked badly .
Cities apart , Dubai government has settled the world of buildings even in oceans .
Conditions were such that poor bachelors would roam here and there in search of a single room .
Two and a half years back such a storm of rents was there in Dubai that many bachelors used to sleep in their cars only .
They would trade for bathing with families living in buildings in the morning and after working day long spend time here and there till late night like vagabonds and on feeling sleepy sleep in their car or on a bench in a park beneath the open sky .
One room ' s rent was three to three and half thousand dirhams in entire Dubai .
To take a good flat in a good locality was like a golden dream .
Gradually staying alone also turning to be expensive they went to their own country .
Today the condition is such that in all directions vacant buildings and flats are visible .
The rates of new houses is about 60 thousand to 35 thousand Dirham and the rent of houses is also halved .
This procedure no doubt affected the economy of Dubai , along with empty houses , empty flats and tall buildings are in search of clients .
Initially there was a visa of 100 Dirhams to go to Dubai .
For an urgent visa more 100 Dirham were to be paid .
This visa was valid for 2 months .
If somebody wanted to increase it for one more month then in 500 Dirhams he  she would get again a visa for one month .
Taking a new visa again in 200 dirhams after two months many people were able to stay again for two months going to ' Kish ' -LRB- Iran -RRB- .
But there is no such arrangement now .
Now there is a visa for one month , two months , or three months , whose only charge is 700 - 800 dirhams .
For people taking visa in black one month visa also costs 1,400 to 1,600 Dirhams .
Even transit visa costs 600 Dirhams .
Plying of people and visiting also reduced because of this reason .
Initially eating out in Dubai was very inexpensive .
But today from the price of food to every other thing has doubled now .
This is why the atmosphere of shopping has turned cold now .
Before coming on vacation every person would do shopping for thousands .
But now because of double inflation people prefer shopping here only after coming back to India .
Also in the beginning declaration were made of attractive gifts with shopping .
Somewhere cars then somewhere heaps of gold and somewhere other attractive things .
But in this period of economic recession the exhibition of all these things has stopped .
Before people used to shop in the lure of prizes and things , specially during Eid and festivals people shopped extensively .
But now gifts have also disappeared and prizes are also lost in the darkness of anonymity .

In this weather if you hang your clothes to dry after washing them in terrace or balcony then the clothes will freeze and become hard like iron sheet and the water drops dripping from the clothes in no time will hang after turning into the shape of a chain of ice .
In such a weather many people instead of keeping milk , butter , vegetables , fruits , etc in fridge keep them outside in balcony and hang them on windows towards outside after packing them in plastic bags .

After getting out of Nagpur station its hard to imagine that a few hours away from here is an ancient and dense forest where the animals considered as dangerous roam freely even today .
You can reach Kanha National Park in six hours from either Nagpur or Jabalpur road way .
From both the cities a government bus runs which goes till the place named Kisli in the core zone -LRB- inner part -RRB- of Kanha .
There are three gates to go to the preserved area of Kanha .
One of them is Kisli .
There is one petrol pump and ten - fifteen houses in Kisli leaving the ' Baghira Log Hut ' of the Madhya Pradesh tourism and a dormitery .
Here you would see deers and baboons more than humans .
Five kilometers away from Kisli is Khatiya village , where more tourists halt .
A caravan of jeeps starts for the Kisli village in the morning and waits at the gate .
The journey of Kanha starts with the first ray of the sun .
There are many fields of wild grass between this jungle of Sal and Bamboo , which give a familiar look to this unusual scene .
Till the morning fog disappears Kanha bathed in the soft light soaks the city concerns of the people sitting in the jeeps .
In the bigger animals you would first of all see deer of many species .
The main among these is the stag , for whose protection Kanha is famous .
The jeep reaches the dense forests running over raw paths crossing many small ditches .
The trees of different species and the different birds hopping and making noise on these become the background of the safari now .
Wild boars can be seen here grazing fearlessly .
The male boar can be heavy till a ton .
Looking at their white hoofs it seems as if this huge creature is roaming wearing socks .
But the animal which pulls people from all over the world to Kanha , that is the tiger .
To see a tiger in Kanha the patience to stay here and the swiftness to start with the first ray of the sun is a must .
One tiger roams in the area of ten kilometers and being the main predator of the jungle likes to move stealthly .
Getting a glimpse of the tiger the deer , peacock and the baboon cry out their calls to caution others , to recognize which among the many other voices in the jungle is an art .
The guide on the jeep and the driver predict the location of the tiger by these danger signals and the paws imprints on the tracks .
If the guide and the driver with you are adept and if they have a good mutual coordination then you can reach near a tiger but to get its glimpse depends completely on the tiger .
If you are coincidently on its way and it decides to pass from near you , then along with fear and excitement you would produce respect in the mind for this royal animal .
Keeping the tourists in mind a tiger show by the elephant is also organised .
A group of mahouts start early at four in the morning on the look out and report to the ranger spotting a tiger .
If the ranger find it right then the mahouts take the tourists on the elephant backs near the tiger .
Along with the splendor of wild life the natural beauty of Kanha has given birth to many stories and legends .
You would know the reason of this reaching from the uneven routes to Kanha 's highest plateau Bamni Dadar .
An untouched image is visible from the field till the sky from this huge grassland in the middle of the jungle .
This plateau is so big that before coming under the protected area small planes used to land here .
The retreating sun sets here in a green ocean .
Rudyard Kipling 's Mowgli perhaps did n't return to the modern civilization impressed with this spectacle itself .
If you wish to come to Kanha from the city via a train or a bus , then along with tourism make introduction with nature your goal .
The jungles in India are depleting and the future of Kanha depends on our awareness and the government 's vigilence .
It is a rare experience in the twenty first century to exhibit a wild tiger roaming in its natural habitat , how important it is to secure this you would understand only when you come to Kanha .
Yes , you would get a glimpse of it in these pictures .
Hon Kong is a beautiful union of the east and the west .
Along with the sky high buildings and the glamour the greenery and the natural beauty is maintained here .
The buildings are so high that to look at these you would get a sprain in the neck and such a spectacle of the city from The Peak as if heaven .
Looking at east the place that glitters the most and is worth attracting the tourists , then it is Hong Kong .
The meaning of it is - aromatic port .
In the older times there used be trading of incensed wood in Aberdeen the main area of the Hong Kong island .
Because of this the whole area used to smell great .
Nature has endowed Hing Kong with unlimited beauty and the people here have respected it along with development .
Upto 40 percent land till Country Park of this beautiful city once a colony of the British was included under its reign by China in 1997 .
The control of Honkong 's security and foreign matters is with China but legal system police , customs and other civil matters are with Hong Kong itself .
The union of east and west is clearly seen on the streets of Hong Kong .
On every shop the names are written in two languages chinese and english .
Both are the official languages here .
Here in many places on one side the things related to chinese culture are on sale while on its side a hollywood movie would be screening , there would be MacDonalds and things related to Western culture .
After Mumbai Hong Kong is the biggest film market of the east .
If you want to see Hong Kong from the heart then you will have to keep on looking up .
In the case of sky high bulidings Hong Kong is the world 's number one .
Here there are 7,700 sky high buildings .
In the world 's 15 highest buildings four are in Hong Kong itself .
The tallest building here is International Finance Centre 21 there is also number one building with the same name but record number 2 is near the building .
The height of this building is around 416 meters .
In the list of world 's highest buildings its number is seventh .
An interesting thing is that in these buildings there are no number 14 and 24 because in chinese culture these numbers are considered unlucky .
The highest building of Hong Kong is Victoria Peak , from where the tourists can see the entire city in just one glance .
To look at the Hong Kong from such height bathed in light , is to exhibit heaven .
You would again and again feel like watching the beautiful Bank of China of here .
The landmass in Hong Kong is less and the number of buildings is a lot .
Among those too most of the buildings are made breaking the historical buildings .
With this though Hong Kong got a modern look , but its historical architecture was lost .
Anyway an important thing , after getting off at the Hong Kong International Airport you should roam around for a while here .
In the last five years this has three times got the award of the most beautiful and comfortable airport .
This is also the world 's busiest airport .

On the name of flora only thorny grass is found here .
But only some special species of grass is seen here .
The main among these species are Imperata cylindrica and Saccharum spontaneum .
Although at a smaller scale some small trees can also be seen on some hills .

For its magnificent pyramids Egypt draws people towards itself from all over the world .
These pyramids put a different kind of world before us .
It is evident that there is an abundance of pyramids here .
But it seems the whole truth of this world is yet to come before us .
Archaeologists have discovered another pyramid below the sands of Sakkara .
The area of Sakkara has been excavated very less so far .
However , several undiscoverd pyramids have been found here in recent years .
It is said that the recently found pyramid is 4300 years old and it was built several hundred years after the Great Pyramids of Giza .
This Pyramid is said to be of Queen Mother Sesheshet of the founder of the sixth dynasty .
This queen had played important role in the establishment of the sixth dynasty by bringing two mutually quarelling branches of the dynasty together .
The pyramids of Egypt tells us the stories of the civilization and magnificent architecture of thousands years ago when it was considered that any king becomes the king of the dead just after dying and some part inside him still keeps on fulfilling the responsibilities as a king .
Therefore his body was transformed into mummies and kept in the pyramid with all those facilities which he might have needed .
The statues of servants were also made to stand inside the pyramid .
This fresh discovery took place in the graveyard of kings of ` Memphis ' the capital of ancient royalty of Egypt 19 kilometres south from Giza .
Buried under the 25 metres of sand only a five metre high cubic part was remaining .
There was so much of sand deposited here that no one even expected what is lying beneath .
Excavation work was on here for last two years but just two months ago it got determined that the structure with a length and breadth of 22 metres is in fact the base of a pyramid .
They also found the parts of white limestone which once must have been applied on the whole of the pyramid .
With the same they also got the help that the pyramid would have been 14 metres high .
This is 118th pyramid discovered in Egypt that is an increase by one in the excuses to go to Egypt .
The first pyramid of Egypt is also said to have been built in Sakkara itself in 2630 before Christ .
This was said to be highest building at that time . After that the popularity of this kind of pyramids grew .

Guest birds have started reaching the Chilka Lake of Orissa the biggest rendezvous of the migratory birds in the country and four lac birds have already reached there .
With this a stop has occurred to those doubts in which it was being apprehended that a fall is going to take place in the number of migratory birds .
Among the initial guests reaching this lake with a total diameter of 1100 kilometres and spread in three districts Khurda , Puri and Ganjam of Orissa are Shoveller , Pintail , Gadwal and Pochard included .
The main stop of the birds is in the Nalban spread in an area of 15 . 53 square kilometres . however birds have reached Manglajodi , Bhusundpur and other places also .
The area of Nalban is declared as the bird sanctuary .
According to the sources of the forest department last year a total of 8 . 93 lac birds of 168 types had reached Chilka .
Out of these 4 . 05 lac birds were in the sanctuary reason itself .
However , every year birds start coming after Dussehra .
But this year the first migratory bird came into sight in the third week of October .
Opening of a new natural mouth near Gabdiha and global warming are also counted as reasons of it .
These birds return back with the start of summer .
Therefore untill they feel coldness in their areas , they would n't move from there .
All the techniques have failed with them .
Considering all these , enjoying the last holidays of the year or the first morning of the new year in this residence of the birds has a unique experience of its own .
Many are fond of adventure but raising that as passion is not easy .
Mandeep Singh Soin is such a passionate person .
In 1992 Limca Book of Records had declared him the Person of the Year .
Sixteen years later Limca Book of Records has selected him to be the Most Versatile Adventurer of 2008 .
Mandeep had debuted in the arena of adventures at the age of 16 itself .
This journey of adventure has taken him to all the parts of the world in search of adventure .
That is why he has enjoyed all the adventures barring only scuba diving .
Mandeep had said in the famous journal Time that the work of pushing the files appeared to me more difficult than climbing the mountain .
The surprising thing is that Mandeep took up this hobby at a time when the environment for this was not so suitable .
But Mandeep born in 1957 and an alumni of the Stephens College of Delhi had established his own company ' Ibax Expeditions ' at the age of mere 22 years making his passion his career .
The start of his campaigns initiated with the campaign of 21 thousand feet high Black Peak during his school days .
After that he has been a part of innumerous campaigns including trekking campaign of 400 kilometres from Manali to Kargil , deep sea fishing campaigns on several islands , single campaign on Bamchu Peak , several campaigns of the Alps mountains in Europe , campaign of two peaks including Independence Peak in the Zanskar region of Laddakh .
He has done long tours with camel in Thar , elephant in Kerala and Jeep in Laddakh .
He has tried his hand at bungee jumping , hot air balloning , sky diving , rafting .
Trekking on the frozen Zanskar river in Laddakh is one among the memorable campaigns .
He did not climb the Everest but Mandeep feels that the highest peak of the world has already been so much measured that there is no enthusiasm left with it .
Mandeep is the founder chairman of the Ecotourism Society of India and trustee of the Himalayan Environment Trust .
He is also a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society of Britain .
He is the first to have received the award for mountaineering , polar campaigns and encouragement to the youth .
Mandeep believes that in India people start considering themselves mentally old pretty early , therefore the culture of adventure has taken a long time to grow in India .
Imagine that your are walking on the slopy ground of green silky grass spread through miles at a height of thousands of feet .
You have only the peaks of the Himalaya covered with snow just in front of you to be touched stretching your hands .
If the sky is changing its color every moment then wherever you spread your eyes you get to see scenes of different varieties , then undoubtedly you will feel this world to be no less than a dream world .
In the base of the glaciers where the timber line -LRB- i . . the rows of trees -RRB- ends , from there the fields of green silky grass start .
Generally these are located at a height of 8 to 10 thousand feet .
In the Garhwal Himalayas these plains are called Bugyals .
Bugyal is the region between the the snow line and tree line .
These work as pastures for the local people and while for the wanderers , gypsies and fans of trekking they work as a place of rest and camp site .
When the white sheet of snow gets spread on the silky grass of the summers in winters then these bugyals become a rendezvous of skiing and other snow games .
You will find this type of bugyal on almost all the trekking routes of Garhwal .
Some bugyals have become so popular that they have become an attraction of the tourists in themselves .
When the snow is melted out then a greenery engulfs around in the environment bathed in rains .
Mountain and valleys keep on shining with varieties of flowers and vegetations .
These bugyals have always been the centres of attraction for the fans of tourism due to their diversity , complexity and beauty .
Nature lovers from all over the world come to tour these slopy pains of silky grass spread in miles .
Its beauty is that you will get to see new color and new scene in all the weathers .
After the rains colorful smiling flowers around on the slopy mountains will be seen welcoming you .
Plants in bugyals grow only upto a certain height .
As per the environment these are not greater heights .
That is why walking on this appears just like walking on a mattress .
However , several small and big bugyals are found in the valleys of Garhwal , but among those which are the most famous among the people Bedni Bugyal , Pawalikantha , Chopta , Auli , Gurson , Banshinarayan and Har ki Doon are the major .
Invaluable herbs like ratanjot , kalank , vajradanti , atish , hatthajadi are also found .
Along with this animals like Himalayan sheep , deer , monal , musk deer and dhorad also can be seen .
Several bugyals fall on the way to Panchkedar i . . Kedarnath , Kalpeshwar , Madmaheshar , Tunganath and Rudranath .
Famous Bedani bugyal falls on the way going to Rupkunda .
To reach this bugyal located at a height of 3354 metres you will need to reach Wan through Karnaprayag from Hrishikesh , Gualdam , Mandoli .
Passing through the dense forests of Wan after an ascension of about 10 kilometres you can enjoy the beauty of Bedani .
The lake spread in the middle of this bugyal enhances the beauty here four folds .
Chopta Bugyal called the Switzerland of Garhwal is located at a height of 2900 metres on the Gopeshwar - Ukhimath - Kedarnath road .
The peaks of the Himalayas can be viewed proximally from Chopta .

You can reach Dayara bugyal through Raithal or Barsu village from Bhatwadi on the Uttarkashi Gangotri road .
Located at a height of 10500 feet this bugyal is also like touring the heaven .
There are so many innumerous bugyals in Garhwal about which people do not yet know .
The whole of its beauty can be felt only by going there .
However it is not possible for everybody to reach these places located at the heights of thousands of feet .
To reach these bugyals you can take bus or rail from any corner of the country to reach Hrishikesh or Kotdwar .
After reaching Hrishikesh and Kotdwar you can reach Chamoli , Tehri and Uttarkashi by bus or taxi .
Through airways also you can get down at the Jolley Grant Airport near Hrishikesh .
Buses or taxis are found easily to reach these small hilly towns .
Reaching these small towns you can get information about the atmosphere here .
The dreamy world of bugyals is toured from here through trekking .
This is a journey of adventure .
It is not appropriate to go to these areas during the rainy season .
If you want to enjoy greenery and flowers then the time of May - June is the best .
In September - October after the rains the nature appears neat and clean .
By this time the color of bugyals are changed .
After that it starts snowing .
Several roads gets closed while several bugyals still keep their pleasantness mantained in the winters as well with skiing .
You will also have to do your preparations according to the weather .

In this weird world of miracles of nature this time the talks of a such a place which is though not very unique but certainly is extremely grand .
We are discussing about the ` Taprobane Island ' just a little away from the world heritage site of Galle in Srilanka .
Just a furlong away from the coast this island is small -LRB- spread in a total area of two and a half acres -RRB- but this is the only island with a private ownership .
The whole of the island is transformed into a hotel .
Taprobane was named such because this is the ancient Greek name of Ceylon .
Due to the shape of this island matching with Ceylone -LRB- present Srilanka -RRB- it got this name .
This island with special romantic ambience can be considered one among the most beautiful places of the world spending a few days of relief .
It is also an extremely appropriate place for marriage , parties and special occasions .
This island was first discovered by Count de Mauny-Talvande the self declared progeny of one of the generals of Napolean who had come to Ceylone along with tea king Thomas Lipton for the first time in 1912 .
He was so impressed by the beauty of Srilanka that after the first world war he came there again to look for a world of his dreams for himself , it took him ten years .
In 1930 he found this island and built a monument , the structure of which was unique with the point of view of European style , as if you were in a cruise boat .
Count Mauny stayed there for thirty years and during that period he hosted many well known personalities of the world .
Interesting thing is that prior to that this island was considered to be cobra-dump because in Srilanka people do not kill snakes , therefore all the cobras caught were left on this island .
Even after the death of the count it kept on drawing many people towards itself .
Many people made it their home for some period .
But gradually people started forgetting it .
In the year of 1995 its present owner took it in his hands and today this is considered among the most romantic inns of the world .
There are five suites in the octagonal hotel with white floor and high roofs of wood on the island .
In each of the suites there are drawing room , verandah and enough open space besides bedrooms giving straight view of the sea .
Each bedroom has its own roof from where one gets the view of the largeness of the Indian ocean .
The central room of the building is thirty feet high in which there is a full arrangement for the natural light and air to come .
The furniture of the building will take you to an era hundred years back .
Infinity Swimming Pool is like bathing in the endless sea .
There is a jungle like garden spread around the building in which you can also enjoy things like losing -LRB- within yourself -RRB- on a desolate island .
Taprobane Island is just in the middle of the Weligama Bay merely 200 yards away from the southern tip of Srilanka .
From the International Airport of Colombo it is a four and a half hour journey by road .
But if you wish to enjoy the adventure a bit more and go by helicopter or sea-plane then the journey remains for a mere one hour .
The water is not very deep from the coast , therefore reaching the island has a different joy .
This southern coast of Srilanka is a new attraction for the tourists throughout the world because here one gets the same view , experience and ambience that is found in Maldives of Thailand .
You will also be surprised to know that between this island and the southern pole there is nothing except unfathomable ocean .
The time from November to April is the best to go here because because these days it does not rain here .
But many people also go here to enjoy rains .
The fare of the suite here is 1750 dollar per night in the month of August and between 21 January to 30 April .
At the same time from 1 September till 14 December and then again from 1 May till 31 July the fare comes down to remain at 1000 dollar per night .
At the end of the year this place is the costliest when between 15 December till 20 January the fare here is 200 dollar per night .
When the wet weather of the rains is about to go light winter is in preparation to come by .
Fans of roaming like this weather extremely .
The greenery spread on the mountains and the softness filled environment start calling them like always , but often the names only those old tourist places are etched on the mind Mussoorie , Manali , Kullu , Shimla , Chail etc .
Tourists have already gone to this place several times .
They know that due to increasing population , army of vehicles , depleting public facilities one does not get the same joy which should come after coming from such afar spending so much of time and money .
What should the government also do , it keeps extremely busy with saving its head and running its cars that is why several such places get left behind where tourists can enjoy naturally if a little preference is given and advertised .
Ninety kilometres away from Chandigarh in the Shivalik mountains at a height of 933 metres from the sea level is the Nahan city settled in 1621 AD .
When the development had not misbehaved with the nature , at that time Nahan keeping all the weather pleasant was called the Bangalore of Himachal .
After bearing all the changes in the weather even today the weather of Nahan is included in the best weathers of select cities of Himachal .
We can call Nahan the city of ponds .
It is good that the whole of the city can be toured in a few hours .
The thin and lean alleys , markets and even roofs here make roaming easy .
One needs to move on foot because there is no local transport , even there is no three wheeler .
Do shopping on foot in the old market , vehicles are prohibited here .
Evenings of Nahan are romantic and calm .
Especially the joys of watching the sunset changing eyecatching color and shape have shone after rains and the lights of Chandigarh , Panchkula , Yamunanagar and nearby at night .
Temples , mosques , gurudwaras and churches are present in Nahan full of nature , art , culture , literature , religious amicability , easiness and satisfaction .
The attraction of evening of Nahan is in the name of Chaugan .
All the chirps of life occur here .

If you come to Nahan then scheduling the time the solitary places nearby can also be toured but one must go to Renuka taking a day out .
The road that turns right from the place named ` Dosadka ' nine kilometres away from Nahan through Shimla road , takes to Renuka .
A little ahead from here is ` Jamta ' from where the colossal view of nearby areas gets joy .
If it had rained then the crowds of cloud keep spreading through miles having come out from the bases of the hills .
Development is taking turns in Jamta .
There are also costly resorts where at each weekend there are advance bookings by people coming to places like Delhi .
If you stay here you will not forget .
The joy for common traveller would be costly .
The road takes down from Jamta .
The hilly villages settled here and there , ladder like fields , varieites of trees , healthy wind of the pine trees , trees and plants laden with wild flowers , the whole of the road is green and serpentine .
Baba Badolia is an attractive stoppage on the way .
If you are walking along the river flowing in the neighborhood then a colony named ` Dadahu ' comes .
There are a couple of good places for eating here .
Crossing a long bridge from here we reach the lap of the Renuka lake .
Renuka has a special place among the natural lakes not only in Himachal but in Asia .
Near the lake spread in an area of about two kilometres it is a total isolation near the lake .
If you want to circumabulate then you can get acquainted with the chirpings of several birds , herbs growing in the greenery .
Small - big trees make the environment pleasant , specially date trees .
The mahseer fish in this lake located at a height of 660 metres from the sea level establish a relationship with the hearts of all elders and young .

If a night is spent in the company of the lake and if this night is wrapped in moonlight then you can spend innumerous moments in being one with yourself or with your most special one .
This opportunity is not possible in the shadow of crowd , vehicles and buildings .
Going to a new place new experiences , new joys and new acquaintances come to our life therefore try to leave reading between the lines this time .
Bhojpur located 32 kilometres away from Bhopal , the capital of Madhya Pradesh , is famous for magnificent and colossal Shiva temple and Jain temple .
This Shiva temple located in the Obedulla Ganj development block of the Goharganj subdivision of Raisen district was built in the 11th century by king Bhoja the First of the Parmar dynasty -LRB- 1010-1155 AD -RRB- .
This specimen of high quality of architecture built on the banks of the Betwa river was built with the help of chief architect of King Bhoja and other scholar architects .
It is also called Bhojeshwar temple .
The largeness of this temple can be estimated with the fact that its platform is 35 metre -LRB- 115 feet -RRB- long , 25 metre -LRB- 82 feet -RRB- wide and 4 metre -LRB- 13 feet -RRB- high .
Built with heavy stones this platform is unique in itself .
The sanctum sanctorum of the Shiva Temple has been built by raising many stones of several tons on this platform .
The sanctum sanctorum is 20 square metre -LRB- 65 square feet -RRB- from outside and 12 . 80 square metre -LRB- 42 square feet -RRB- from inside .
The large shivlinga in the temple is located on the Gauri platform built 7 . 90 metre -LRB- 26 feet -RRB- high .
Shivlinga is 2 . metre -LRB- 7 . feet -RRB- high and its periphery is of 5 . metre -LRB- 18 feet -RRB- .
It is considered by some people as the highest Shivlinga of India .
To enter the sanctorum there is a 10 metre high and 4 metre wide gate .
This temple is the signature of the great personality and foresightedness of King Bhoja .
Bhoja 's father Sindhu King was killed at the hands of Chalukya king Telpa in the south Godavari river . it is believed that King Bhoja had built the Shiv Temple in his memory the design of which is called Swargarohanprasad .
Bhoja built many temples .
There is a beautiful Jain temple at a distance of one kilometre from the Shiva Temple .
Like the Shiva Temple it is also incomplete .
King Bhoja is mentioned on the edicts there .
There are statues of Jain Tirthankaras in the temple .
According to the literature available at the local level the main statue among them is that of Tirthankar Shantinath , while it has been called as the 20 feet high statue of Lord Mahavira in the website of State Tourism and Raisen district .
At some other places it has been written as the statue of Adinath .
According to the archaeological department there are two small statues of Parshwanath and Suparshwanath on both the sides of the main statue .
This region is related to Sage Mantungacharya the creator of Bhaktamar hymn .
His monument is built here .
The pleasant view around provides peace of the soul .
Bhoja had started a school to give expertise in architecture for the training of the architects .
But due to sudden death of the king both the work of Shiva Temple in its last stage and the school got closed .
Even the incomplete temple is so magnificent that the experts say that if it was completed it would have been unparalleled .
By some historians it is also called the Somnath of the east .
Later the local people also started collecting stones of the platform according to their needs and also caused some damage .
Besides this in 15th century the Sultan of Mandu Hoshang Shah invaded and caused heavy damage to the platform and the temple .
The dam and lake that was built by King Bhoja with the help of expert engineers , they were also heavily damaged and the water system was brought into titters .
In fact two colossal dams built with stones are also counted among the achievements of King Bhoja .
It is said that the lake was surrounded by hills all the sides and the way was from only two places - one of hundred yards and another of five hundred yards .
Bhoja had bound the lake by building dam with stones .
The smaller dam was 44 feet high and three hundred feet thick from below .
The bigger dam was 24 feet high and hundred feet wide .
Together both the dams used to stop the water of the lake spread in 250 square miles .
A story in the Gond tribe tells that when Hoshang Shah broke the smaller dam then it took the whole of his army three months to break it .
After the breaking of the dam it took three years for the water to dry out and till further thirty years that land was not worth residence .
It is said that due to this lake drying up the weather of Malwa changed forever .
There was a time when the Bhojeshwar temple at the fag end of the lake spread from Bhojpur to Bhopal was seen standing .
The stone that was used to in building the temple was achieved from the rocky areas of Bhojpur itself .
Near the temple and afar the ruins of cutting of rocks can be seen even today .
According to Vidya Dahejia the writer of Early Stone Temples of Orissa there is a similarity seen in building the Shiva Temple of Bhojpur and Ling Raj Temple of Bhuvaneshwar and some other temples .
Shivlinga is 2 . metre -LRB- 7 . feet -RRB- high and its periphery is of 5 . metre -LRB- 18 feet -RRB- .
Because the cave is on the other side of the river therefore to go across the river boats are available .
Though the famous Shiva Temple of Bhojpur is standing in the desolate rocky area but there is no dearth of devotees .
Each year a huge fair takes place here .
Reach Bhopal through air or rail ways from any corner of the country .
The distance of Bhojpur from Bhopal is 32 kms .
Private vehicle is more appropriate for tours .
Get down at Bhojpur running on the Bhopal Mandideep Road from the bus stand .
The fare takes 8 - 10 rupess per person .
Take tempo for the temple from there .
Its fare is also 8 - 10 rupess per person .
There is no place for staying in the temple or nearby i . . Bhopal would be appropriate for stay .
The talk of the beauty of Sikkim is common .
But here we are talking of the place which has achieved the fame of the most beautiful village of Sikkim .
The name of this village is Lachung .
This status was given to it by the roamer Joseph Dalton Hooker in The Himalayan Journal published in 1855 .
But even without that seal of Joseph Dalton this village is interesting .
This is very near the border of China in North Sikkim .
Lachung is located at a height of 9600 feet on the confluence of Lachen and Lachung rivers .
These rivers merge with Tista river ahead .
Cold is throughout the year at such height .
But if it has snowed then its beauty gets a novel dimension ... taking photos of which you can decorate in your drawing room .
Therefore people come in the weather of cold also pretty much .
Besides natural beauty the particular thing about Sikkim is that even with snow fall this area remains as much accessible .
If accessibility is easy then there is nothing but joy of touring .
Peaks laden with snow , waterfalls , rivers twinkling like silver mesmerise the tourists coming here .
Lachung is such a place .
Generally , Lachung is used as the base for Yumthang Valley .
Yumthang valley is also called the Switzerland of the East .
Many more things can be done in Lachung besides going to Yumthang .
On the peak of a different hill is the Lachung Monastery .
If you sit to meditate in the magnificent valley then you might lose yourself .
Located at a height of about 12 thousand feet Nyingmapa , this monastery of the Buddhists , was established in 1806 .
Besides this there is a handloom center in Lachung where local handicraft can be explored .
The Shingba Rhodendron -LRB- Buransh -RRB- sanctuary is nearby .
The trees of Buransh coloring the Himalayan trees at the heights above seven-eight thousand feet can be felt here with extreme proximity .
There are about 25 varieties of rhododendron here .
Nepali , Lepcha and Bhuita are the natives here .
One also gets a beautiful opportunit to mix with their culture .
Kancenjunga National Park is also in the same area .
Ahead of Yumthang one can go up to ` Yume-Samdong ' .
That is the last tip of the road .
Standing at this height , where the air also becomes a bit thin , watching the views ahead is a rare opportunity .
The greatest time to go to Lachung is from October to May .
While this valley will appear laden with flowers in April - May it will be laden with snow in January - February .
There is a different beauty of different times .
Lachung is 117 kilometres away from Gangtok .
From Gangtok this road can be covered in Jeep in five hours .
From Lachung the Yumthang valley is 24 kilometres away .
Jeeps go up to Yumthang .
The road is through Fodong , Mangan , Singhik and Chungthang .
Jeeps can be found from Gangtok .
One must remember that jeeps - cars coming from outside can not cover the journey ahead .
Therefore the arrangement for vehicle has to be done locally .
After the start of border trade between India - China the communication of tourists have also increased in this area .
Prior to this in 1950 even before China 's occupation over Tibet Lachung used to function as the trade square between Sikkim and Tibet .
Later this area remained closed for common people for a long time .
Now along with situation becoming normal at the border tourists have again started going there .
Therefore many hotels have also been built there .
Cheap and costly , both the types of hotels can be found .
It would be better if the booking for the hotels is done from Gangtok itself .
Sikkim is more calm than other Himalayan states .
Each year in December Food and Culture Festival is organised in Gangtok .
In January Makar Sankranti is celebrated as Magh Sankranti here .
A big fair takes place on the confluence of Tista and Ringgit river in which local people and tourists participate .
Besides this there are respective attractive religious ceremonies of different Buddhist monasteries .

Neither any urban structure nor any tension .
The natives of this region are tribes .
In this region with extremely less population sometimes no human stir is seen for quite a long distance .
Activities taking place are visible only in the city .
Because all the region comes under the army cantonment therefore sale-purchase of land or properties does not take place here .

Orchha has got the status of second Ayodhya .
Here Ramraja is present in his child form .
It is a hearsay that Sri Ram here rest here by the day and in Ayodhya at night .
After evening aarti his flame is submitted to Hanumanji , who takes him to Ayodhya for night rest .
It is mentioned in the scriptures that the primitive Manu-Satrupa had penanced for thousands of years to achieve Sheshshayi Vishnu in the childform .
Being pleased Vishnu blessed her and incarnated as Rama in Treta , Krishna in Dwapar and Ramaraja of Orccha in Kaliyug .
Thus Madhukar Shah and his wife Ganeshkunwari were incarnations of Dashrath and Kaushalya .
In Treta Dashrath could not coronate his son , this wish of his also got fulfilled in Kaliyug .
There is an enchanting story of Ramraja coming to Orccha from Ayodhya .
One day the Orchha king Madhukarshah asked her wife Ganeshkunwari to go to Vrindavan with the intent of worshipping Krishna .
But the queen was devotee of Rama .
She declined to go to Vrindavan .
In anger the king asked her if you are such a big devotee of Rama then go and bring your Rama to Orccha .
Reaching Ayodhya the queen , building a cottage near the Laxman Fort on the banks of Sarayu river , started her prayer .
These days the Great Sage Tulsidas was also busy in prayer in Ayodhya .
Getting blessings from the sage the prayer of the queen got firmer and firmer .
But the Queen could not get to see Ramraja for several months .
Being frustrated finally she jumped into the middle of the Saryu to leave her life .
Here in the unfathomable depths of the water she got face to face with Rajraja .
The Queen told him of her intent .
Ramraja accepted to go to Orccha but he put up three conditions , first - this journey would be on feet , second , the journey will be only in Pushpa nakshatra , third - the statue of Ramraja will not move again from the place where it is placed once .
The queen sent the message to the king that she is coming to Orccha with Ramraja .
To install the statue of Ramraja Madhukarshar built the Chaturbhuj Temple at a cost of crores .
When the queen reached Orccha then she kept this temple in her palace .
It was decided that at the auspicious time the statue will be kept and inaugurated in the Chaturbhuj Temple .
But this statue of Rama denied to go to the Chaturbhuj Temple .
It is said that Rama came here in child form and how could he leave the palace of the mother and go to the temple ?
Ram is present in the same palace even today and the Chaturbhuj Temple built at a cost of crores is still desolate .
This temple is still devoid of statue .
It is also a coincidence that the day of 1631 Samvat Ramraja came to Orccha , the same day the writing of Ramcharit Manas also got completed .
It is said about the statue that is present in Orccha that when Ram was going for exile then he gave one child statue of his to mother Kaushalya .
Mother Kaushalya used to offer Bal Bhoga to the same .
When Ram came back to Ayodhya then Kaushalya offered this statue in the Sarayu river .
Ganeshkunwari found this statue in the middle of the Sarayu river .
This is the lone temple of the world where Ram is worshipped as king and he is offered salutes before the sunrise and after the sunset .
Here Rama is considered as the king of Orccha .
There are temples of Hanumanji all around the Ramraja temple .
Temples of Chhadadari Hanuman , Hanuman of Bajaria , Lanka Hanuman are all around in the form of security circle .
Among other precious heritages of Orccha Laxmi Temple , Panchamukhi Mahadeo , Radhika Bihari Temple , Rajamahal , Raipravin Mahal , Hall of Hardaul , Monument of Hardaul , Jehangir Mahal and its paintings are major .

After this when we moved a little more than we saw a happy elephant .
The tusk of the elephant were very big and it was coming from somewhere .
But its tusks kept on entangling with trees again and again .
Untangling them it kept on moving .
As we were watching its antics while sitting on our bikes then suddenly he came in front of a gypsy .
Without any delay the driver of the vehicle backed his vehicle and distanced away from there fast through another way .
Later when we asked the guide then he said that both the ears of the elephant had totally tensed which meant that he got angry .

After drinking tea we started to stroll all around the temple but the heart was restless to go inside the quilt .
There was time for the meal to get ready .

The sun continued to dominate and Himalayas in front of us kept changing colors and becoming more alluring .
How much time was spent we did n't come to know .
On seeing Himalayas in front of us we felt as if coming here was successful .
When we began to take a stroll in Haripurdhar then we felt as is mother nature has created nature with an open heart .
Wherever our eyes went everything looked panoramic , winsome , enchanting .
Around one kilometre far from temple on the frontier of contemporary Sirmaur kingdom a luthkadi fort got constructed by King Hariprakash for a watch and fort made on the frontier of contemporary Jubbal kingdom and the ariel view of halipad - all are the center of attraction for tourists .
This place is excellent for trekking lovers .
For stay in Haridharpur apart from four family suits -LRB- with two rooms -RRB- 30 rooms are also available .
No trouble for parking .
For daily needs thee are more than half a dozen shops .
Library is under construction .
The temple committee has constructed Tracker hostel near the temple with the help of Tourism department .
If you want then you can also stay in PWD rest house or a private rest house .
The simplicity and devoted hospitality of the workers there in temple premises won our hearts .
The journey of Haripurdhar , considered a little brave journey , was one step ahead not behind the journeys of very popular tourist spots .
In one glance Haripurdhar is 106 kilometres from Nahan .
Buses go till Dadahu .
Jeeps also ply till Andheri .
There are few sources further but if personal vehicle is there then no problem is there .
In Haripurdhar situated at a height of 2687 meters above sea level , even during summers weathers cools down in evening .
A requirement for light warm clothes can be there .
World 's third highest peak Kanchenjunga is also here whose golden beauty of sunrise leaves a deep imprint on the viewers .
It is clear that under the shadow of such mountain there are many areas present for trekking from the ordinary to high trekking in whichthe stamina of tourists on foot is tested .
Otherwise in Sikkim said to be the nature 's own garden and the region of flowers many rivers and snowy regions are located at many places in all directions for other brave activities but the thrill of high trekking in western Sikkim is different .
Yuksam has stayed the first capital of Sikkim , whose height above sea level is 5600 foot .
Base camps are put here only for treks like Jogri Jemathang and ascent on Kanchenjunga due to which the significance of western Sikkim increases .
Many other treks also begin from here .
Some time before the tourism department of Sikkim government had organised National High Altitude Trekking Program in which trekking groups from many parts of the country participated .
When our group set out from Delhi then stayed at Darjeeling for two days where International Himalayan Mountaineering Meet was organised .
We attended it .
Apart from great mountaineers like Sir Edmund Hillary and his wife , his mountaineer son Peter Hillary , Tenzing Norgay , Nwang Gombu , his daughter Rita Gombu , Fu Dorjee , we also met some mountaineers of Italy and Spain .
From Darjeeling we moved towards Sikkim .
Our bus crossed Rangit river which determines the border of West Bengal and Sikkim .
In Peling we stayed for a night .
Maximum mates enjoyed the consumption of local intoxicant named Rakshit .
The next day we were in Yuksam .
Like normally it is important on going at any place with altitude -LRB- 13 - 14 thousand foot above -RRB- , we had to stay here for two days acclimatise ourselves .
There is an overbearing influence of leech in this area full of dampness and moisture .
They can be found from an open area to even in your bed .
To safeguard from them we were given salt to put in our shoes .
Even then it is only a probability that someone remains untouched from their attack .
Nearby at an elevated spot is an ancient Buddhist Monastery .
On the second day we went there and on return we got together for the preparation of going on trekking the next day .
On putting salt in our shoes we set out for our first halt Soka .
There were flowers at many places on the beautiful plants of rhododendron through which we kept moving ahead .
On seeing forest somewhere and the flow of water at other places we would forget our tiredness .
Met Yaks as well on the way .
Before evening descended we had reached Soka .
When we began to walk for our next halt Jongari then rain came and surrounded us .
Heavy rains increased our problems .
As we were moving ahead foliage was decreasing .
Only rhododendron flowers were seen more .
Post noon we had reached Jongri .
There snowfall took place .
All around there was snow and cold was also more .
the arrangement of tea and food was of government everywhere and there was no need for us to make food but due to the effect of height there was no desire to eat anything .
Sleeping at night also became difficult .
Next morning some members were hesitating from moving ahead .
But with courage all moved together .
Because of no practice of trek at high altitudes how the lack of oxygen can be fulfilled . had no knowledge about it .
While moving towards Thhanjing we saw grand view of Narsingh mountain and Pandim peak .
The shine of snow on both the mountains in the glittering sunshine was not letting us stare at it for long .
It did n't take us much time to reach the destination spot because we were going a little below the height of Jongri and distance was also not much .
In Sikkim Sumiti lake is also called as mini Maansarovar .
On time to time basis black swans are also visible here .
Jemathhang is also along the lake .
As if the nature kept the weather nice to bless us but even before afternoon the weather began to get bad .
We spent a good amount of time beside the lake .
the shadow of Gochha peak situated at a height of 16200 foot was visible in the lake .
Perhaps somebody had gone till Gochha La .
In the afternoon we returned back to Thaanjing .
The return to Thuksam had began .
Although nobody had a heart to return leaving the beauty of the lake .
On the journey of Sumati lake of Thhanjhing only a beautiful scene of Kanchenjunga from Aunglathang can be seen .
The next morning we had our breakfast and then after resting for a while we began trekking .
Unfortunately the effect of height was beginning to be felt by me .
Not even one step ahead could I walk .
Some mates tried to give me support but I could not walk .
I kept sitting and the members of first group and then the vice captain of the group and then the captain also moved ahead quietly .
In the end the most slow walking two members Dr . Yadav and Professor Yadav came to me .
Taking my condition seriously both of them halted there .
There was a porter also with them .
Firstly , Dr . Yadav made me drink a lot of sweetened drink so that through water the level of oxygen increase n my body .
Then they made me sleep .
Around one hour I kept sleeping and they kept sitting beside me .
Finally they decided that I should be taken back to Thhanjing .
Dr . Yadav and porter carried me till the camp bearing difficulties .
Professor Shekhar kept moving ahead gradually so that Dr . Yadav meet him again .
It was night already .
Doctor and porter set out towards Lampokhari after carrying me till camp .
Camp leader arranged five porters by giving information here and there by a wireless set and next day those porters one by one took me to Soka camp through some shorter way by carrying me on their back .
Here due to less height my situation began to improve .
I was grateful to those porters who helped me in such a situation .
Hilly people are known for such helpful nature as well .
After spending a night in Lampokhari my mates came to Kasturi Aural and I reached Yuksam from Soka .
Next day all members came together as well .
All narrated their own stories and problems and celebrated the happiness of the completion of trekking mission .
Before beginning trekking we had seen a female member from a group that had come from Mumbai get unwell .
She could not go ahead .
One female mate of hers did not leave her alone and without trekking she returned to Mumbai taking her friend along .
The organisers no doubt praised the girl , also praised Dr . Yadav and Professor Shekhar .
Next day we were given a farewell after being given a certificate from the tourism department of Sikkim government .
We returned to Delhi via Gangtok .
In Sikkim neither there is any railway station nor an airport .
But despite this there is no problem reaching there .
Bagdogra airport in the northern part of West Bengal is the nearest for Sikkim .
There are daily flights from Guwahati , Kolkata and Delhi .
From airport the Sikkim 's capital Gangtok is 124 kms away .
This path you can also cover through road and if you want then can also take advantage of the helicopter service of Sikkim tourism department between Bagdogra and Gangtok .
For Sikkim the two nearest station are Silligudi and New Jalpaigudi .
Their distance from Gangtok are 114 and 125 kilometres respectively .
In Sikkim the roads are good and maximum parts of far flung areas are also connected to good roads .
Because of being a frontier area foreign citizens have to take an Inner Line Permit -LRB- ILP -RRB- which they get on the basis of their visa .
Permit is obtained even after reaching Sikkim whose duration is 15 days .
This period can be increased .
There is no dearth of hotels and lodges in Sikkim .
According to every income group here appropriate place to stay will be found .
Either in government sector or in private sector .
Because of being on the foothills of the Himalayas the weather here is like other Himalayan regions only .
Winters very cold and summers pleasing .
Only try to save yourself from rains because the joy of visiting mountains is spoiled in rains .
The time from March to June and then October to December is the best to go here .
In Nepal nine National Parks and three Wild Life Conservation regions are there under which world 's highest mountains and along with plains of foothills are also there .
Endangered species like Royal Bengal Tiger , one horned rhinoceros and bharal are safe in these parks .
Southern plain region which is known by the name of Tarai , is surrounded with thick forests .

If a pair of binoculars is taken along to see birds then it will be more joyous .
If we go in the middle of the forest then various kinds of joys can be experienced .
Then leaving the pathways you can go till the deep regions of the forest .
Where tourists normally can not go .
Just a little love for thrill is required .
Hot air ballooning in Nepal is liked more by tourists .
Like a bird taking a flight in sky an ariel view of Kathmandu can be seen In it in the background of Himalayan mountains .
If the weather is clear then this is the most thrilling way to see Kathmandu and Himalayas from a height of 1500 - 2000 meters .
The flight is quite light and without any problem which can not even be felt .
The best time to saunter like this in sky is in winters from October - April the time at which the peaks of mountains keep covered with snow and are clearly visible .
The mountainous flight of one hour provides the unique joy of the panorama of Himalayas and of Everest from close without climbing it and ariel view of other mountains of eight thousand meter .
Comparison of this mountain flight to experience to see the world 's highest mountain from calm sky can not be done with any thing else .
Otherwise hundreds of such domestic airlines make us see such mountainous scenes year long .
Jet scooter in the fast water current of Trishuli is actually a very new and thrilling way of discovering the country 's most beautiful water way .

In the oceans of Andaman a little away from Indian water area is Phuket .
It is very popular worldwide among tourists who like fun and frolic .
If there is talk regarding Phuket then a reference to it 's night life is there for sure .
Patong beach is the main center here .
In Thailand only Bangkok , Pataya and Patong are known for intoxicating nights .
Patong is on the western end of Phuket .
Mainly two areas of Patong beach are famous - Bangla road and Paradise complex theme bar , are famous for discotheque and Go - Go bar .
Foreign , specially for European and Australian tourists this is the biggest attraction here .

Thailand is known for one more thing as well , and that is boxing .
After Cuba , Thailand has been known as the mine of boxing .
Boxing is also a common game here especially kickboxing or Muay Thai .
One more best way to spend a night at Phuket is also to see a show of Muay Thai .
The interesting thing is this that boxers participating in the competition , before the match , in an open van in evening , in the middle of a boxing ring while roaming around the roads give invitations to people to come .
Somewhat like that way when at our place to call people in circus rickshaws roam around but here the participants themselves also get down on roads .
Patong beach is around 15 kilometres far from the city .
On the beach road you can take a ride of a four wheeler auto rickshaw tuk tuk , colored in bright red and standing in queue or can also enjoy the taste of sea food being cooked on stalls in the style of Khaalis chowpatty while standing on the edge of sea shore .
The point worth praise here is that Phuket and specially Patong beach had to suffer a good amount of loss in Tsunami that came in December 2004 .

The regions tolerating more loss , today , after four and a half years narrate the storey of human 's passion .
Island safari of Phuket is very popular .
The special point to see here is how human is successful in training wild animals .

Specially the caressing by an elephant of a man lying beneath his legs and trunk is the one that can take us by a surprise .
Even monkeys show many similar acrobatics but one special thing in the training of monkeys is to teach breaking coconuts as well .
This training is not only to gain applause but also to earn bread and butter .

Perplexity can be on knowing the names of those cities as well whom Udaipur has defeated in this competition .
Last year Bangkok was at the top in this list .
Cities like Sydney included in the top ten since last ten years are defeated this time .
The chief editor of the magazine Nancy Novogrod believes that this point can also be contributing in Udaipur 's coming at top position that first time in fourteen years results of readers of South Asia , South - East Asia , China , Australia and Newzealand , Turkey and Mexico editions were also included .
Her belief was that the world has shrunk , in which traditional places have become a little more familiar and less thrilling .

She said that she is in love with this city .
Along with the natural beauty of Udaipur and the royal hotels and resorts there Novogrod especially praised the art collection .

The speciality of this two storied temple built on the bank of a beautiful pool is the mosaic done on it 's outer walls .
In this mosaic somewhere is Sun atop its seven horses , somewhere Vishnu and somewhere other group of Gods .
If nothing else then sexual idols .
Possibly architect was unknown to the philosophy of the copulating idols , otherwise would imitate them as well .
Despite it 's grandeur and attraction this temple is untouched by tourists .
Only on some religious occasions devotees pray it .
The entire ambience lives up by this temple standing between the fields .
The greenery surrounding it enhance it 's beauty .
The lifeless atmosphere here is even far away from the fear of priests .

Near the temple itself is a long and wide field of Kholikhand Doobachaud .
Here ion the day of Raksha Bandhan thrilling war of bagwaal or stones take place .
Behind this thrilling game of stones many folk beliefs are associated .
According to them only during the ancient times to make goddess Barahi Devi happy there was a ritual to present a human sacrifice .
It is said that every year from the families of all four khaps sacrifice of one member was given .
Once came the turn of the grandson of an old lady in a Khap but that lady refused to sacrifice her grandson .
So that the Goddess does not turn wrathful , thinking this the villagers decided that by playing Bagwaal which means a thrilling game of stones continuously blood should be shed from one human body .
Since then as the symbolic protest of human sacrifice keeping this tradition alive on the day of Raksha Bandhan the people of all the four Khaps reach here with drums and barrels and play the thrilling game of stones .
Warriors of all the four Khaps reach the temple of Goddess Barahi in the battle ground Kholikhand and Dubachaud in traditional war attire and with shields in hands with drums and kettledrums .
First of all a perambulation of temple and worshipping is done by the warriors of all the four Khaps and then in the long and wide courtyard of war they take position at the from for the war .
The warriors of Lamgadia and Balig khap are in southern direction and the warriors of Gaharwal and Chamyal are in the northern direction .
With the sound of conch shell of priest begins Bagwaal and then begins a thrilling war of stones in which people 's heart skips a beat .
During the war wounded warriors consider the wound from stones as god food from the Goddess .
During war the scene of the field is worth seeing .
warriors defend themselves from the shields made of bamboos .
No kind of dressing is done on this wound .
The time at which this thrilling war continues , priests keep praying to Goddess Baraahi sitting inside the temple .
Suddenly he would reach the field passionately and sounds conch shell with the sounding of conch shell of the priest this thrilling game of stones is stopped .
After this the warriors of all the four Khaps embrace each other .
Before this in morning in the temple people of all four Khaps take the idol of goddess Varaahi in Nandgrah , where idols are bathed with milk and decorated with new clothes .
During normal days this idol stays in a copper box , in one part of which idols of Goddess kaali and in another part Goddess saraswati have also been kept .

Even today on the bank of Vyas river this tree is standing a little drowned in water .
The wall that the contractors used to build to save the old road from breaking would be found broken the next day .

The devotee Contractor got a very small temple made .
After the construction of highway again the goddess gave inspiration to some devotees to make a worship place on the edge of highway .
