join both files to filej
	$~/tools/cdec/corpus/paste-files.pl english hindi > en_hi
randomize lines in filej
	$python shuffle.py en_hi
split filej into both lang file

get training and test data
	$head -n 23000 corpus.en > train.en

get vector space for both languages-got vectors for words

find the alignments between parallel training texts
so given a word s it will be aligned to words t1,t2,t3... ( take top 5? words and make a table ( sort of phrase table but for word a piece) also get probability for this p1,p2,p3...)
so structure will be sort of:
[s]->[w1]+[p1]
[s]->[w2]+[p2]
[s]->[w3]+[p3]
...
so source word s goes to word w1 with prob p1
[q] signify word-vector of q

so now train a neural network 
with input [s] ||| output [w1]+[p1] for full table
